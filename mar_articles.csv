There are a number of Mexican dishes, alongside soft scrambled eggs with smoked trout from the chapter on breakfast all day; kimchi in sandwiches; and several recipes for grits, thanks to the chef, Chris Bradley from North Carolina, who is also an author. Some dishes call for local nettles, mushrooms and ramps. Essays on moonshine, the borscht belt and folk music are included."

"497","Really great poetry is difficult to read. I don’t just mean it’s challenging, though it usually is. I mean it’s hard to make progress, because the density of meaning in the language stops you; it makes you read in loops.

Alice Notley’s best work feels this way: intensely recursive, almost too good to read. In its semantic density, great poetry gives you the sense you’ve skipped over and missed some available shade of meaning. You certainly have."

Jean-Raymond has outgrown the current space, and not just in a physical sense; in the time he’s been working here, his renown, as the head of his seven-year-old label, Pyer Moss, but also as a representative of the fashion industry’s future, has grown immensely. What started as a fairly humble streetwear line has expanded into an ambitious conceptual project. Jean-Raymond is the child of Haitian immigrants, and his designs — especially the way he presents them publicly — collectively offer a strikingly personal and singular narrative about his own life as a black designer in America. He’s become successful as a result of this, receiving praise from critics and counting among his clients and collaborators people like Erykah Badu, Usher, Rihanna and Michelle Obama."

"578","IT’S COMMON PRACTICE, though often somewhat unspoken, that when a seminal playwright learns that one of his older, popular works will see a major theatrical revival, he might revise — or update entirely — his original script, finding all the places where the plot’s mechanisms, characters’ speaking patterns or writer’s attempts at humor or historical context have been rendered obsolete. But when the American playwright Richard Greenberg learned last year that Second Stage Theater on Broadway would be mounting his 2002 play “Take Me Out” — about a fictional New York baseball legend named Darren Lemming who comes out as gay, to the confusion and sometimes disgust of his occasionally naked teammates (the primary setting is their locker room) — Greenberg, 62, decided there was no use trying to modernize it in advance of its April premiere."

The fortune amassed by Cookie (John Magaro) and King-Lu (Orion Lee), partners in a mid-19th-century artisanal snack-food start-up in a rough section of the Oregon Territory, is a modest one: a cloth sack filled with shells, cutup coins and company scrip. The crime that brings them that bounty is correspondingly small-scale. Under cover of night, the two men sneak over to a pasture near the cabin they share and milk someone else’s cow.

"635","The stylist Ibrahim Kamara has spent some time considering alternate realities. His work, which incorporates both current high-fashion looks and pieces from his personal collection (some of them are even sourced from dumpster dives), often weaves together what’s traditionally termed masculine and feminine; as part of 2026, a project with the South African photographer Kristin-Lee Moolman that appeared in a group exhibition at Somerset House in 2016, he imagined how men’s wear might reflect changing attitudes about masculinity a decade later. For the cover of T’s spring Men’s Fashion issue, Kamara partnered with the photography duo Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott to conjure a hauntingly dissonant landscape. They imagined an apocalyptic wasteland where delicate decorative accents — like floral headpieces and billowing sleeves — and bondage-inflected leather and metal hardware come together with hardy utilitarian underpinnings to create something radical and new."

But they have a way of finding Rose (the comedian Maeve Higgins), a driving instructor who does her best to deny her knack for communicating with them. It’s complicated: Her father (Risteard Cooper) hosted a video series on supernatural occurrences, and she was his partner in all things paranormal. Then he died in a freak accident involving a dog and a haunted pothole, an incident for which Rose blames herself."

"668","TWENTIES 10 p.m. on BET. After Lena Waithe’s groundbreaking 2017 Emmy win — in which she became the first African-American woman to receive an Emmy for outstanding writing in a comedy series — the filmmaker Ava DuVernay posted to social media a photograph of a young Waithe balancing trays of coffee in the back seat of a car. It was a throwback to Waithe’s early career, in which she was an assistant to people in Hollywood, including DuVernay. That period of Waithe’s life provides the basis for her new, semi-autobiographical comedy series, “Twenties,” which centers on a 24-year-old aspiring television writer, Hattie (Jonica T. Gibbs) — though it moves the action to the present day. “This is our world post my character on ‘Master of None;’ it’s a world post ‘Get Out’; it’s a world post ‘Moonlight,’” Waithe said of the show in a recent interview with The New York Times. “This is the first time a masculine-of-center black woman has been the center of a show on prime-time TV.”"

"678","IT’S COMMON PRACTICE, though often somewhat unspoken, that when a seminal playwright learns that one of his older, popular works will see a major theatrical revival, he might revise — or update entirely — his original script, finding all the places where the plot’s mechanisms, characters’ speaking patterns or writer’s attempts at humor or historical context have been rendered obsolete. But when the American playwright Richard Greenberg learned last year that Second Stage Theater on Broadway would be mounting his 2002 play “Take Me Out” — about a fictional New York baseball legend named Darren Lemming who comes out as gay, to the confusion and sometimes disgust of his occasionally naked teammates (the primary setting is their locker room) — Greenberg, 62, decided there was no use trying to modernize it in advance of its April premiere."
"679","WASHINGTON — The argument at times sounded like a sterile analysis undertaken by management consultants: What were the benefits of requiring doctors who perform abortions to have relationships with nearby hospitals? Would requiring such relationships force abortion clinics to close?"
"680","Maybe you’ve seen spaghetti squash in the grocery store, but passed it by because the idea of cutting, peeling and preparing it was just too daunting. Fear no more. Spaghetti squash gets its name from its flesh, which resembles delicate strands of angel hair pasta when cooked. Many love that the squash is low in calories and high in fiber. When prepared and seasoned well (it can be bland, so be bold), the cooked squash can be served under blanket of marinara, tucked into casseroles, stirred into stews and even baked into quick breads."

The property is at the end of a road, with winter views of Lake Michigan. The Riverpoint Village Shopping Center, at the intersection of two highways, is two miles northwest, and Doctors Park, a green space and beachfront reserve, is a mile and a half north."

"702","The new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, now threatening to snowball into a full-fledged pandemic, has already begun to wreak a sort of global havoc, causing alarm and even panic in several countries, spasms in financial markets and, most painfully, loss of life. There has been very little time so far for reflection, and few of us have stopped to wonder what this crisis might tell us about ourselves — about our bodies, our communities, our political systems and the nature of our growing interconnectedness across borders. But I believe it has something crucial to tell."
"703","NEW DELHI — Forty-six people have been killed, more than 250 injured and four mosques set on fire in the sectarian violence in Delhi that coincided with President Trump’s visit to India."
"704","ORLANDO, Fla. — For the past 10 years, Ricky Dillon, 27, has documented every major moment of his life on YouTube."
"705","“The Banker” plucks an obscure figure out of history to very mixed effect. Set largely before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it tells the story of an African-American entrepreneur, Bernard S. Garrett, as he takes on racism in real estate and banking. It’s an appealing David and Goliath setup that uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics. (It’s inspired by real events that legal records suggest may be more complicated.)"
"706","The sunlight over Los Angeles looks unusually gray and muted throughout “The Way Back,” set largely in the isolated coastal neighborhood of San Pedro, where, in the late 1920s, homes toppled into the ocean. Although “The Way Back” takes place in the present, a sense of disordered lives pervades this tough-minded studio film, which has the outward trappings of an inspirational sports drama but is primarily a recovery movie. The star, Ben Affleck, has been open about drawing on his own experiences with drinking for the role."
"707","The New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, held every March at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, is the world’s premier gathering of buyers, sellers and lovers of rare books. It’s a kind of Woodstock for the ultra-bookish, where museum-like displays of stunningly bound 16th-century volumes and illuminated manuscripts are surrounded by booths specializing in rare maps, historical documents, vintage crime novels, counterculture ephemera and just about anything else, as long as it’s (mostly) on paper."
"708","Super Tuesday was not the electric showing many fans of Bernie Sanders had hoped for. While some early projections forecast he would win as many as eight out of 14 states and amass a significant lead in pledged delegates, voters delivered a more modest outcome. Mr. Sanders won four states, including delegate-rich California, and ended the night nearly tied with Joe Biden in total pledged delegates. Most worrying for Mr. Sanders’s campaign, the hoped-for youth turnout did not materialize, while Mr. Biden enjoyed the kind of suburban surge that handed Democrats the 2018 midterms."
"709","Robin, a.k.a. the Boy Wonder, celebrates his birthday this week: He made his debut in Detective Comics No. 38 on March 6, 1940, and he and Batman became nearly inseparable in the war on crime.

We reached for each other through the film of separate dreams and then fell back in states of mutual surprise, nonverbally reaffirmed. That night, however, he slept. The thin light spilled through the air shaft and onto our bed, and in it he looked strange. Not less attractive—if anything, more so—but also not quite like the man I’d married not so long ago. His chin was slack. His brow furrowed with some small concern. I rubbed my eyes. Misha was older than I was by only a few months, but in that moment it seemed a whole decade had intervened. I reached out to touch his cheek across a stretch of time. He didn’t stir."

There’s Jeff Sharlet’s “This Brilliant Darkness,” a book of photographs and short essays documenting his encounters with strangers. There’s Kim Ghattas’s political study “Black Wave,” about the regional power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And there are books about the consequences of demonizing the other: Philippe Lançon’s “Disturbance” is a memoir of his recovery after surviving the terrorist attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, and Kiran Millwood Hargrave’s historical novel “The Mercies” revisits the real-life Vardo witch trials of 17th-century Norway, while Candacy Taylor (“Overground Railroad”) and Gretchen Sorin (“Driving While Black”) both look at the harrowing steps black travelers had to take to navigate, literally, the roads of Jim Crow America."

"997","Death Stranding, the newest video game from the developer Hideo Kojima, was introduced to the world in the summer of 2016 on a stage at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the gaming industry’s annual trade-show extravaganza. The event was what the industry calls a press conference, but this particular spectacle more closely resembled the scene in “King Kong” when the beast is displayed to the public in a Broadway theater. A live orchestra struck up a blaring John Williams-style score as the curtain lifted to reveal a sloping stage, at the very top of which stood Kojima, a slight Japanese man with swooping black hair and glasses. The floor began to light up underneath him, panes of light flying in from left and right to create a sort of light bridge, which he bounded down to shake a Sony executive’s hand. Then he stood at center stage, beaming, to deafening applause."

"1003","Imagine we are living in the year 2030. New seismic activity indicates an underground nuclear explosion somewhere near the Arctic Circle. One more country announces it’s joining the once-exclusive club  of nuclear weapons states that has now grown to 20 nations — more than double the number in 2020."
"1004","On Dec. 29, 2019, as the 2010s came to a close, the Times Sunday Review looked back.

"1007","PARIS — Some performances come at just the right time. On Monday, the French author Virginie Despentes was greeted with a roar when she stepped onstage at the Théâtre Bobino for “Viril,” a performance that was part rock concert, part feminist monologues. After Roman Polanski’s triumph three days earlier at the César Awards, France’s equivalent of the Oscars, Despentes had just published a furious opinion piece in the French newspaper Libération — under the headline “From Now On, We Get Up and We Leave” — and the youthful crowd was clearly on her side."

"1014","A nation is broken. Life savings have vanished overnight. Home as a place you thought you would live forever no longer exists. People don’t so much connect as collide, even members of the same family. And it seems like winter is never going to end."
"1015","Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with reduced levels of beta amyloid, the protein that forms the brain plaques of Alzheimer’s disease, a new study suggests."
"1016","Compared to other sports, surfing requires less gear to get started. But if you are planning to take lessons on your next beach vacation, you will want to pack a few things to keep yourself safe and comfortable while still being able to move freely. No need to buy a wet suit — along with a board, the surf school will provide one if it’s necessary — but consider bringing the following items. And don’t forget a tube of good reef-safe sunscreen."
"1017","At Rice & Miso in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, the most distinctive Japanese rice ball filling is a savory paste made from miso, garlic and onion that tastes electric, like a current rippling across your tongue. When the grip of salt subsides, the flavor takes a different shape: a fruity, almost floral, sweetness that reminded me of Muscat grape. Not the fruit, but the grape-flavored Kasugai gummies from Japan."
"1018","How far will art fairs go to make themselves educational affairs on par with museum exhibitions? What can these events, where dealers convene to sell their wares to well-heeled collectors, do to set themselves apart from their competitors? As fairs proliferate, to about 300 worldwide, their organizers introduce new features, like panel discussions and concerts, meant to add intellectual heft and to cultivate and entertain broader audiences. (Confession: I myself recently served as the inaugural “writer in residence” at the Untitled San Francisco fair.)"

"1038","The writer Walker Percy’s foreword to “A Confederacy of Dunces” is only a couple of pages long, but in it he gets across the dramatic essentials of the novel’s tortuous path to publication: that the much-rejected manuscript was orphaned when its author, John Kennedy Toole, killed himself in 1969; that Toole’s mother, Thelma, was tenacious in pressing Percy to read it; that when at last he did, he discovered a “gargantuan tumultuous human tragicomedy” that he helped usher into the wider world."

"1049","The novel on which this movie is based, a slim thriller by the great American writer Charles Willeford, is in many ways typical of the author. It examines misogyny and murderous psychosis from so seemingly close a perspective as to make the reader queasy, if not downright upset.

"1058","Amory Houghton Jr., who stepped down as head of his family’s venerable glass works corporation to serve for two decades as a wealthy congressman from upstate New York, becoming a leading moderate Republican voice who defied his party’s hard-right turn, died on Wednesday at his home in Corning, N.Y.

"1061","LOS ANGELES — A normal day on board the Grand Princess cruise ship might go like this: Sleep late under a “European-inspired duvet.” Take a dip in one of the pools on deck. Afternoon tea promises white tablecloths and finger sandwiches. Dinner could be lobster tails and steak on a private balcony. And all evening, there are plenty of things to do, from theater to gambling to dancing."
"1062","To write a series of poems out of extreme illness is a bracing accomplishment indeed. In “Deluge,” her first full-length book, Leila Chatti, born of a Catholic mother and a Muslim father, brilliantly explores the trauma. In a frightening two-year saga of a tumor and the “flooding” it caused, Chatti finds not disassociation but deeper association with her own experience. Her strikingly personal relationship with Mary — who appears in both the Quran and the Bible — becomes a profound and steadying compass, as do lines from many other poets and philosophers, woven into the text in cento style. Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye"
"1063","Americans have always assumed that the key to undoing the all-encompassing framework of white supremacy lies, in part, in literacy. Literacy helped combat slavery in practical ways — reading and writing meant you could more easily escape by forging free papers, for example. But there was also literacy’s metaphysical promise — that you could write your way into new futures, into places that existed outside of imaginations made narrow by anti-blackness. Think of Frederick Douglass tricking white boys into teaching him to form letters, or Toni Morrison proudly displaying a letter from the Texas Board of Corrections declaring that it had banned her novel “Paradise,” because of its potential to start a riot. Books and reading are dangerous, which is why the question of which books are made available to children is always contested."
"1064","A United States immigration judge has ordered that a Tennessee man who served as a guard at a Nazi concentration camp in Germany during World War II be deported to the country, where he is a citizen and has continued to receive a pension based on his employment, “including his wartime service.”"

"1069","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration will deploy 160 troops to two ports of entry along the southwestern border before a Supreme Court decision that officials fear could prompt large crowds of migrants to seek entry into the United States."
"1070","Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the hockey player Mika Zibanejad’s five-goal game for the Rangers misstated the status of his contract. He is in the third of its five years, not the second."
"1071","To the Editor:"
"1072","WASHINGTON — A union representing federal asylum officers said on Friday that a Trump administration policy that diverts migrants at the southwestern border to Guatemala unlawfully sends a vulnerable population to a country “in which their lives and freedom are directly threatened.”"
"1073","It was Stephen Curry vs. Kyle Lowry again Thursday night, as the Golden State Warriors faced off against the Toronto Raptors in their first matchup since last year’s N.B.A. finals. The game went back and forth, and just like in the series-clinching Game 6 of the finals at Oracle Arena, the Raptors prevailed in the final minutes."
"1074","TAMPA, Fla. — The good news: The source of the mysterious pain in Aaron Judge’s shoulder and chest has finally been identified. He has a stress fracture in his uppermost right rib. The bad news: He has a stress fracture in his uppermost right rib that will keep him out of the Yankees lineup on opening day, and surgery hasn’t been ruled out yet."
"1075","SHINNECOCK NATION, Southampton, N.Y. — A maritime people who once spanned a large swath of the eastern Long Island shore, the Shinnecock Indians have been hemmed into a 1.5-square-mile patch of land on the edge of a brackish bay. Now, because of climate change, they’re battling to hold on to what they have left."

"1080","SUNDAY PUZZLE — What a great week of puzzles! I fell for every trick. I knew something was up on Monday (it was actually “nothing”), tried every rebus in the book for the “one up” trick on Wednesday and fell into the same trap on Thursday. Más, please! Take heart that we’ll see all of these constructors again: So have no remorse, just some pleasant nostalgia and optimism over the deep bench of brilliant women who we are lucky to get to solve."

Gallen, a 24-year-old right-hander, had thrived in his first taste of the majors — before and after his trade from the Miami Marlins — and the team gave him a model for the kind of pitcher to emulate: Madison Bumgarner.

"1136","An article on Thursday about a record number of parliamentary seats won by Arab-led parties in Israel’s election referred incorrectly to the number of Israelis who are of Arab ethnicity. It is about one in five, not two in five. The article also misstated Arab turnout in Israeli elections. It fell below 50 percent in the April election, but it is not the case that turnout has been below that level historically."
"1137","HILLARY Stream on Hulu. “We want to hear your story, unvarnished, beginning to end,” the filmmaker Nanette Burstein tells Hillary Clinton at the start of this documentary. “Hillary” relays that story in four parts, beginning with her path from a childhood in the Chicago suburbs to becoming the first lady of Arkansas in the early 1980s. Subsequent installments cover her time as the first lady of the United States, as a United States senator and ultimately as a presidential candidate. The documentary places interviews with Bill Clinton and the journalist Joe Klein, among others, alongside archival footage, thought it’s built largely around Burstein’s interviews with Clinton herself. The first question: “Do you feel frustrated that you’ve been in public life for 30 years, yet people feel that they don’t know who you are, that you seem inauthentic?” (It surely can’t be a spoiler to reveal that Clinton’s answer is yes.)"

But they have a way of finding Rose (the comedian Maeve Higgins), a driving instructor who does her best to deny her knack for communicating with them. It’s complicated: Her father (Risteard Cooper) hosted a video series on supernatural occurrences, and she was his partner in all things paranormal. Then he died in a freak accident involving a dog and a haunted pothole, an incident for which Rose blames herself."

"1152","When “Amazing Stories” premiered on NBC in 1985, “peak TV” was, by most definitions, still a glimmer in premium cable’s eye. In hindsight, the series presaged what would come to be a new gold standard for television: big budgets, A-list talent and an auteur creator — in this case Steven Spielberg, whose Amblin Entertainment spent up to $1 million per half-hour episode."

His collection has grown to include over 300 pieces, which he houses in a Haussmannian-style apartment beside the Seine, where he moved to in 2009. Takada sources many of his items from Japan and Hong Kong (he travels to Asia six times a year) and his favorite Paris antique shops.

"1180","Last year the Armory Show weathered a crisis when Pier 92 over the Hudson River was condemned shortly before the art fair opened, precipitating a last-minute reshuffling of booths and the shutting down of a satellite display. This year, the fair has settled on Pier 90 and Pier 94 (dress for the outdoor walk between them) and the catastrophe is the coronavirus, which had already forced the cancellation of Art Basel Hong Kong last month. Though the Armory Show has opened smoothly, hand sanitizer stations are everywhere and elbow-bumping has replaced handshaking and air-kissing as the greeting du jour."

This isn’t quite Ali Gascoigne’s New York Times debut, as he constructed a Monday puzzle last February (perhaps you remember the debut of BRAINFOODS? It was a good puzzle). When that one came out, Deb Amlen interviewed Mr. Gascoigne and gleaned tidbits of knowledge like his day job (marketing strategist) and his cryptic nom de plume (Gila, a river and a poisonous lizard, and also Ali G in reverse)."
"1183","EVROS, Greece — The farmers and pensioners wore black clothes and heavy boots, imitating Greece’s special forces, and trod along a rural road on a night patrol looking for migrants trying to cross the northern land border with Turkey. “We’ll get you next time!” they shouted at a small group of men who had made it over and fled."

"1201","The New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, held every March at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, is the world’s premier gathering of buyers, sellers and lovers of rare books. It’s a kind of Woodstock for the ultra-bookish, where museum-like displays of stunningly bound 16th-century volumes and illuminated manuscripts are surrounded by booths specializing in rare maps, historical documents, vintage crime novels, counterculture ephemera and just about anything else, as long as it’s (mostly) on paper."
"1202","Coming-of-age novels aren’t my particular passion — unless there’s a murder in the story. There’s a doozy of a murder in Kate Weinberg’s hypnotic debut mystery, THE TRUANTS (Putnam, 311 pp., $26), one that might have met with the approval of the Queen of Crime, Agatha Christie. Dame Agatha happens to figure tangentially in this uncommonly clever whodunit, which makes plentiful references to her books, plot twists, settings and even the 11 days in 1926 when she inexplicably disappeared — all while coming across as madly original."

Then, the guns come out, history rushes in and a ghost pops by. (It smiles.)"

I had woken, as I sometimes do, in a fit of desire that was usually reciprocated, as if Misha and I were wired to the same internal alarm: we woke up as one. This was often how we began to make love. We reached for each other through the film of separate dreams and then fell back in states of mutual surprise, nonverbally reaffirmed. That night, however, he slept. The thin light spilled through the air shaft and onto our bed, and in it he looked strange. Not less attractive—if anything, more so—but also not quite like the man I’d married not so long ago. His chin was slack. His brow furrowed with some small concern. I rubbed my eyes. Misha was older than I was by only a few months, but in that moment it seemed a whole decade had intervened. I reached out to touch his cheek across a stretch of time. He didn’t stir."

This week’s recommended titles include a handful of books about conflict or conciliation between opposing groups. There’s Colum McCann’s new novel, “Apeirogon,” based on the true-life friendship between an Israeli man and a Palestinian man who both lost young daughters to Middle Eastern violence. There’s Jeff Sharlet’s “This Brilliant Darkness,” a book of photographs and short essays documenting his encounters with strangers. There’s Kim Ghattas’s political study “Black Wave,” about the regional power struggle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And there are books about the consequences of demonizing the other: Philippe Lançon’s “Disturbance” is a memoir of his recovery after surviving the terrorist attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, and Kiran Millwood Hargrave’s historical novel “The Mercies” revisits the real-life Vardo witch trials of 17th-century Norway, while Candacy Taylor (“Overground Railroad”) and Gretchen Sorin (“Driving While Black”) both look at the harrowing steps black travelers had to take to navigate, literally, the roads of Jim Crow America."

He performs and takes credit for their songs, becoming a rock star overnight. But a familiar lesson arises: Fame can’t buy love after all. The movie opened to mixed reviews last summer. Some critics said it’s best enjoyed if not taken too seriously, while others, like The New York Times’s A.O.

"1738","There’s a new player on the mock-meat front: vegan corned beef. Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut."

Products can be sampled and bought."
"1740","“Stairway to Heaven” is an original — no new trial needed."
"1741","MOSCOW — The American political world has — once again — become consumed with the influence of Russia, trying to make sense of whom the Kremlin might favor in the presidential election: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, or both. But for me, an American journalist based in Moscow since 2012, that is a far less interesting topic than the story of the convergence between Russia’s political culture and our own."

"2033","The world’s first high-frequency automatic chronograph was introduced in 1969 by Zenith, a Swiss watchmaker founded more than a century before in the town of Le Locle. Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com."

It followed the detective Gereon Rath and the aspiring police officer Charlotte Ritter as they came up against rising nationalist sentiments, a stolen train filled with Soviet gold and a disastrous May Day confrontation between the police and Communists, all set in the years that preceded the Third Reich. In its third season, the show returns to explore aspects of Berlin’s gritty underworld and growing film industry as Rath and Ritter work to track down a cloaked killer who’s been terrorizing a movie shoot. Along the way, Ritter works to gain respect with the homicide squad, Rath encounters troubles at home, and the country braces for financial collapse."

"2109","The world’s first high-frequency automatic chronograph was introduced in 1969 by Zenith, a Swiss watchmaker founded more than a century before in the town of Le Locle. Unrivaled in timing precision (to one-tenth of a second) with a barrel-shaped tonneau case displaying a round dial with three charcoal-tinted subdials, the El Primero was considered a mechanical marvel; its chronograph module used an entirely integrated caliber, not just one bolted to an existing automatic movement. But the El Primero wasn’t on top for long: Just a few years later, quartz — an element that enabled watches to tell time even more accurately — threatened to make mechanical watches obsolete. Luckily, Zenith’s chronograph, along with the company, was saved when, in 1988, Rolex used the elegantly slender, self-winding caliber to power an updated version of its classic Daytona, which turned the movement into a cult favorite. Fifty years after El Primero’s debut, the company has released a timepiece that pays homage to the original 1969 model. Just two small tweaks were needed to bring it into the present: The hollow links of the original bracelet designed by the renowned Geneva firm Gay Frères have been rendered in solid steel; and there’s now a sapphire crystal caseback, the better to fixate endlessly on a timepiece that helped fine horology take a leap into the future. $8,200, zenith-watches.com."

"2215","There’s a new player on the mock-meat front: vegan corned beef. Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut."

"2237","WASHINGTON — With the Democratic presidential contest down to a two-person race, Senator Bernie Sanders has declared that he will wield his signature issue, Medicare for all, as a crucial distinction between his campaign and the surging candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden."
"2238","ROME — Where does God self-quarantine during an epidemic? Not in a church, probably. At least not in a church in northern Italy, the center of the largest coronavirus outbreak in a Western country so far. Masses and other religious services, including funerals, have been suspended for weeks there, in keeping with government rulings to curb the contagion. On Sunday, the same day the government announced that the north was going under lockdown, all religious services throughout Italy, including those at mosques and synagogues, were canceled until at least April 3. (On Monday, travel restrictions were extended to the whole country.)"

"2241","For the last three years, two factors have been hugely influential in the oil markets. The first has been the surge of shale oil production in the United States, which has turned the country from a large oil importer to an increasingly important exporter. The second is the alliance between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which recently have cooperated in trimming production to try to counter shale’s impact."

"2243","Nearly everything the ceramist and designer Eny Lee Parker makes is meant to offset what she sees as the tedium of domestic architecture. “We have a floor, a neat vertical wall and then a horizontal,” she says. “We live in boxes.” Since receiving her M.F.A. from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2017, she’s developed an array of distinctive hand-built ceramic furniture and objects, from bouclé- and mohair-upholstered stools to interlocking earrings, with pleasing, curvilinear shapes that look like naturally occurring phenomena. Parker, 30, was born to Korean parents in Brazil, where she roamed the craft stalls of the beach town of Fortaleza. But for her latest collection — a series of 11 lamps, mirrors, stools and side tables titled Internal-izing — she looked past the shoreline to something much smaller: an individual cell."
"2244","ALICE LEMOINE WAS a moody adolescent in 1997 when her parents moved her and her two siblings from an 18th-century house in Bordeaux’s center to a newly constructed Modernist villa designed by the celebrated Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas in a nearby suburb. Too young to appreciate the Brutalist allure of the building, a cantilevered rusted steel box with poured-concrete walls and floors of pale green resin and aluminum, she hated how sound carried between the kids’ upstairs bedrooms. And then there were the passing tour buses, loaded with gawkers trying to catch sight of the architectural masterpiece, which is among the only residential structures that Koolhaas, 75, has ever built."
"2245","Melissa Clark and I were in Toronto over the weekend, eating marvelous fried ocean smelts among about a thousand other things at Brothers on Bay Street, before taking the stage at the Hot Docs festival with the reporter and critic Chris Nuttall-Smith to talk about Melissa’s new book, “Dinner in French.” (We also talked about my new book, “See You on Sunday.” But this story’s about Melissa.) During our discussion, Melissa riffed about a late-night dinner of sardines on baguette, the bread toasted and rubbed with a clove of garlic and plenty of tomato before she lays the fish out across it to eat with a glass of wine. The audience swooned and I got hungry and that’s our no-recipe recipe of the week. Won’t you give it a try?"

"2250","It was a concession speech, of a kind: Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders bowed not to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who trounced him in a second consecutive week of primary elections, but to the reality of his political predicament. Stripped of his briefly held status as the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was “losing” to Mr. Biden but stopped short of accepting defeat."

"2253","There’s a new player on the mock-meat front: vegan corned beef. Jenny Goldfarb, a vegan for nearly 10 years whose family was in the Jewish deli business in New York, decided that the taste of a hefty corned beef sandwich or a Reuben should not be on vegans’ no-fly list. She spent months in her kitchen experimenting with wheat, chickpeas, beets, tomatoes, spices, sweeteners and yeast, and finally, in 2018, began introducing the results in Los Angeles. Sarge’s Delicatessen & Diner in New York started serving her Mrs. Goldfarb’s Unreal Deli Corned Beef in January. It’s increasingly sold nationwide. The “meat” approximates the slightly crumbly texture of the real thing fairly well, and delivers its salty, somewhat smoky flavor. (It’s also kosher.) It’s a true departure from the usual burgers and sausages that vegan meat mimics. But what’s missing is the fat, especially for those, like me, who do not prefer lean corned beef. Thus, it’s best in a sandwich dressed with mustard and coleslaw or in a Reuben, in the company of gooey Russian dressing, melting vegan cheese and a moist layer of sauerkraut."

In the truck she calls her “Bloom Mobile 1.0,” Kaifa Anderson-Hall recovers flowers from venues all over the Washington, D.C., area that would otherwise be discarded and gives them a purpose. After being preserved, often for weeks in refrigerators she keeps in the basement of a four-unit apartment building she and her husband own, those flowers take on their second job — in therapeutic activities with seniors, homeless women and people with disabilities around the city."
"2257","The current snow-sports season is far from over, but the companies running the popular multiresort passes would like you to start thinking about the next one. Passes from the three main players are now on sale for the 2020-21 season, with incentives to buy early: As time goes on, prices go up and some perks vanish. The renewal discount for the 2020-21 Ikon Pass and Ikon Base Pass, for example, ends on April 22."

The French author Henry de Montherlant said that “happiness writes in white ink on a white page.” It can’t be captured; not with dignity, anyway. Happy art so often equals kitsch.

"2263","Pixar’s “Onward” is the No. 1 movie in America. But what if “Contagion” is the No. 1 movie in our psyches? It’s currently way up there on the iTunes movie chart, which means we are paying for Steven Soderbergh’s nine-year-old sign of pandemic life. Covid-19 is upon us, infecting and killing people, compelling quarantine and “social distancing.” Planes are empty. Conferences and tennis tournaments are being scrapped. The new James Bond movie has been wishfully rescheduled for healthier climes."

"2276","André Hueston Mack, a sommelier and winemaker, started feeling that the expanding roster of well-made American cured hams was not being given its due. “There are ham bars in Spain and France, but nothing like them in New York,” he said. So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant."

"2286","If South Carolina was make or break for Joe Biden, then so was Michigan for Bernie Sanders. After falling behind Biden in the Super Tuesday primaries last week, Sanders needed Michigan — where he won a stunning upset against Hillary Clinton four years ago — to reinvigorate his campaign and restore its glow of victory in the wake of his Nevada caucus win."
"2287","Bernie Sanders often cites Denmark as the kind of country he would like America to be under his ideology of “democratic socialism.” Well, here’s a news flash: Bernie Sanders, with his hostile attitudes toward free trade, free markets and multinational corporations, probably couldn’t get elected to a municipal council in Denmark today. Ironically, Joe Biden, with his more balanced views on trade, corporations and unions, probably could. And therein lies a column."

"2818","André Hueston Mack, a sommelier and winemaker, started feeling that the expanding roster of well-made American cured hams was not being given its due. “There are ham bars in Spain and France, but nothing like them in New York,” he said. So he has now become a hammelier and opened his own spot, a sliver of brick walls and mirrors with just 20 seats in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where he lives with his wife, Phoebe Damrosch, a writer and a partner in the restaurant, and their four sons. They have at least 11 American cured heritage-breed hams on the menu. Some are from venerable producers that have been curing hams for 100 years or more, and others are the work of newcomers. Many of the hams are from Kentucky, and some, like the ruddy Dakota, are on a more-or-less exclusive basis. The chef Cesare Casella’s prosciutto from upstate New York also gets its turn on the vintage slicer. Cornmeal madeleines and American cheeses are served, and Mr. Mack limits his wines to American selections. “I have about 320 labels, many from vintages going back to the 1970s and ’80s,” he said. He grew up in Texas, and began his wine career at the French Laundry. He went on to work at Per Se, and left to start making his own wine, which he still does, with Maison Noir Wines, in Oregon. He also runs a wine shop, VyneYard, nearby. In a few months, he plans a retail shop, & Sons Buttery, selling hams, cheeses, condiments and table accessories, next door to the restaurant."

The book is not prophecy, but its appearance in the middle of the worst pandemic in living memory is not entirely coincidental either.

How could we fail to preserve the institutions and social order that define us when we are confronted with something unexpected — a catastrophe that in retrospect seems all but inevitable?"

She connects with a military veteran (played by a newcomer, Aaron Paul) and convinces him that humans and droids both live in cages, their lives predetermined. (This series is certainly not a pick-me-up.) Other new cast members include Vincent Cassel and Lena Waithe. “The show’s production remains sleek and eye-catching,” Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times. “And the moment may be exactly right for a paranoid meditation on the possible end of the human race.” The first season finale of AVENUE 5 follows at 10:15 p.m."

It’s a summerlike evening in February at Aglietti’s home in Silver Lake, and Aglietti is sautéing fresh blue prawns in mezcal and chili oil while Jimenez leans against the kitchen counter, keeping her company.

There have been other dark moments throughout the series — but this is the episode when the darkness really stood out. From the start of the episode — when several Romulans stand in a circle, go insane and commit suicide — to Admiral Clancy’s randomly telling Picard to shut up with an unnecessary expletive, I kept thinking that this is a grim world Picard inhabits — and a much different one than the franchise creator, Gene Roddenberry, had in mind decades ago."

What’s more, it’s insufficient to protect the older, sick, homeless and isolated people who are most vulnerable to the virus. They need extra care and attention to survive, not society’s back."

We have come a long way since Vin Diesel and Paul Walker played Californian street racers in 2001’s “The Fast and the Furious.” The franchise has ballooned since then, and its latest offering is this spinoff. In “Hobbs & Shaw,” which takes place between “Fate of the Furious” (2017) and the upcoming “F9,” Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham reprise their roles from earlier “Furious” movies, reluctantly teaming up to keep a genetically enhanced supervillain (Idris Elba) from getting his hands on a deadly virus. Their mission ties in Shaw’s formidable sister (Vanessa Kirby), a rogue MI6 agent, and takes them to Chernobyl and then Samoa. The plot is hardly the point — the main attraction is the scathing banter between the leading men and the over-the-top, gravity-defying stunts.

But his new book, “Later: My Life at the Edge of the World,” intimately and extensively recounts the time he spent there in the early 1990s, growing into his own, sexually and emotionally, in a community grappling with the AIDS epidemic. On one page, Lisicky remembers wondering: “How will I ever be able to leave this haven, so far from the repression and punishments of adulthood? Am I trapped in sweetness now?” And soon after, he’s describing the men who had come to Provincetown to live out their last days. “A retirement community,” he calls the town. “Say, Sun City, Ariz., but for young men in their 20s and 30s.” Below, Lisicky talks about the project’s false starts, learning not to suppress anger, his longtime love of Joni Mitchell’s music and more."

While later she became known for her realistic depictions of flowers and animals, especially the house’s now iconic panther (her nick­name was La Panthère), in the early years, she explored geometric form and unusual gems. Among them was the rare pinkish-orange imperial topaz, mined in the 19th century in western Russia’s Ural Mountains, when only the czar’s family were allowed to wear the stones. This new necklace features three exquisite imperial topazes from Brazil, including a dangling 11-carat pear-cut bicolor stone with an ombré effect that shifts from fuchsia to Tuscan yellow. Set off by diamonds, colored sapphires and rutilated quartz prized for its slash-like inclusions, it evokes Toussaint’s combustible combination of classical discipline and modern exuberance.

Some people get distracted and spend the day washing dishes, watering plants, organizing socks. Others suffer from having no one to report to. My personal demon is loneliness.

"3821","The subtitle for this compact guide to the history of household items calls them “everyday.” Though most of the 63 alphabetical entries — like napkins, forks and even picnic baskets — are common enough, there’s also a more arcane jib door, Louis XIV chair and flokati rug. Many items have evolved from ancient or Medieval days; the author’s descriptions are trivia-packed. Take chopsticks, for example: While most people know they came about because of Chinese dining, some will be surprised to learn that disposable pairs date back to 18th century Japan, where they were named waribashi. Moreover, strict Japanese chopstick etiquette notes that sauce dripping from the ends, called “crying chopsticks,” is unacceptable."

"4125","There’s a pleasing symmetry to “Dedicado a Max,” an episode that could be more accurately titled “A Tale of Two Coots.” The bifurcated plot revolves around a pair of ornery old men. Both are natural-born fighters who don’t like to be told what to do. One is in a house that people want him evicted from, that he refuses to leave. The other is in a house that people want to stay in that he would like to flee."

"4149","First the schools closed, then the babysitter canceled."
"4150","Like many a dedicated home-design maximalist, I have moments in which I bemoan my aesthetic tendencies. While normally content to be surrounded by all my stuff — the 10,000 books collected over a lifetime of reading (with room for 2,000 more); the lacquerware from Japan and brass opium weights from Laos and silver figurines from Thailand; the 19th-century pine blanket chest, a fixture from my childhood, packed full with 18th-century American quilts and modern textiles from India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan — it takes only a single encounter with true minimalism to make me doubt my own sense of pleasure, which is the worst sort of doubt in its own small way."
"4151","New York was still making money a week ago. A few people wearing masks, some closings, but generally business as usual. And then we tumbled down a cliff. By Friday, commuters arriving at Grand Central Terminal paused as they entered the main concourse — stunned by its emptiness, the usual din quieted by stay-at-home orders from companies and the government. For the first time, the vast, star-covered ceiling seemed appropriate."

"4156","So our question for today is: What is the appropriate attitude toward Donald Trump in a time of national crisis?"
"4157","In 1941, with war tearing through Europe and Asia, and America on the precipice of joining the conflict, President Franklin D. Roosevelt compelled and inspired industries and individuals to rally for the greater good. Food was rationed without rioting, and car plants all but stopped producing automobiles in favor of tanks and fuselages. By 1944, American factory workers were building nearly 100,000 warplanes a year — or about 11 per hour."
"4158","My friend begged his parents not to go to the shiva. The person who had died was from a prominent family in their Long Island community, and he knew that during the traditional seven days of mourning hundreds of people would be passing through the synagogue where the shiva was being held."
"4159","In 1918, a new respiratory virus invaded the human population and killed between 50 million and 100 million people — adjusted for population, that would equal 220 million to 430 million people today. Late last year another new respiratory virus invaded the human population, and the reality of a pandemic is now upon us. Although clearly a serious threat to human health, it does not appear to be as deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic. But it is far more lethal than 2009’s H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic, and the coronavirus does not resemble SARS, MERS or Ebola, all of which can be easily contained."

"4161","MILAN — None of us have ever experienced a tragedy like it."
"4162","Like many people all over the world, I am not leaving the house now. For me, though, staying home is nothing new. I am in bed as I write this, propped up by my usual heap of cushions, talking to other sick and disabled people all day on my laptop about how the hell we’re going to care for one another in the coming weeks with a gnawing feeling of dread in my belly."
"4163","Today was the 11th morning I’ve packed lunches for my three children, prodded them to put on their shoes and hunted for library books under the couch since learning that my home state of New York had been hit by a dangerous respiratory virus."
"4164","It seemed like the most minor of mysteries, the kind a friend or spouse might indulge before gently changing the subject: A man who can’t remember the name or artist of a favorite song from his youth struggles to find either online."
"4165","Where once technology was thought to be the death knell of human social interaction, it is now bringing us together under quarantine. The housebound are nimbly pivoting to virtual social gatherings."
"4166","The only thing that should have been different about the first Friday in March was the apple crisp. Heaven Frilot didn’t usually cook at the end of the workweek, instead letting her family snack on leftovers — a roast or pork chops she’d made earlier, maybe — or order pizza. But her 10-year-old son, Ethan, was having a friend over that night, and her husband, Mark, a lawyer, was coming off a crushing week of arbitration. She would bake an apple crisp."
"4167","Since the arrival of the new coronavirus, each month, each week, each day has manifested a new city in place of the old one."
"4168","Judith Matloff, who teaches crisis reporting at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, has found herself in some tight situations, like being trapped in a hotel during a civil war in Angola. The experience, she said, was dicier than, say, staying inside a New York apartment to avoid a dangerous virus, but there were some similarities, too."
"4169","Amy Gross had been looking forward to a party that would rival the luster of the Save Venice ball last year. A lavishly costumed affair that lit up the Plaza hotel in New York, it was seeded with social royalty and party fixtures including Lauren Santo Domingo, Princes Maria Olympia of Greece and Nicky Hilton Rothschild, each descending the grand staircase in cascades of organza and lace."
"4170","Every Sunday night for six years, Louis Kornfeld and Rick Andrews have walked onstage at the Magnet Theater in Manhattan and created a refined hourlong play from scratch. These impromptu comedies stand out in a New York improv scene filled with quick-hit jokes and formulaic patterns, appearing more like scripted theater than almost any other improv show in the city."
"4171","Most of New York’s museums and art galleries have closed, but the city remains full of aesthetic destinations that can be experienced outdoors and alone. While we’re all facing a lot more time apart from one another, I’ve been thinking back to the long, solitary walks I used to take, and the monuments, buildings and public art works that served me as both friends and destinations. Whether I was living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan or in the other boroughs, there was always some interesting sight nearby to occasion a reflective journey."

"4523","BIG TIME ADOLESCENCE (2020) Stream on Hulu. Pete Davidson plays a role model with platinum blond hair and a taste for weed in this coarse coming-of-age comedy, the debut film of the writer-director Jason Orley. The plot centers on a brotherly relationship between Davidson’s character, a 23-year-old named Zeke, and Mo (Griffin Gluck), his ex-girlfriend’s 16-year-old younger brother, whom he walks through the finer points of the suburban slacker lifestyle. The story also involves small-time drug dealing and Mo’s pursuit of a crush (played by Oona Laurence). “Though Davidson, Gluck and Laurence show star potential, Orley either boxes them into a too-conventional coming-of-age arc or gives them cloyingly charming characteristics,” Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Despite some moments of tenderness and easy chemistry between Zeke and Mo,” Kim added, “‘Big Time Adolescence’ doesn’t have enough heart or humor to save it from becoming just another movie about white dudes bro-ing out.”"

"4649","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — It started last Tuesday, a sudden decline in the number of haircuts. By Saturday, the salon owner, Zach Edwards, was sitting in his office looking nervously at a line of empty barber chairs."
"4650","We all know what it’s like to worry that something terrible has happened to a person we care about, as the hours pass and there is still no word and even implausible explanations (flat tire, broken phone) become increasingly unlikely. Plunging his main character into that excruciating situation — subjecting her to that “great, black maw of fear” — is the first diabolical thing that Chris Bohjalian does in his terrific new thriller, “The Red Lotus.”"
"4651","So Donald Trump is now calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus.” Of course he is: Racism and blaming other people for his own failures are the defining features of his presidency. But if we’re going to give it a nickname, much better to refer to it as the “Trump pandemic.”"
"4652","Screw this virus. Screw this virus that is already ravaging families, burying people in the hard isolation of the same four walls, leaving waitresses in anguish about how they’re going to pay the rent. If you don’t have a little hate in your heart toward this thing, you probably aren’t motivated enough."

On Thursday evening, in a prime-time speech to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged his 1.3 billion citizens to “avoid crowds and stay at home.”"
"4655","The World Health Organization, for weeks now, has been making an emphatic plea to countries around the world: Social distancing is crucial to stopping the spread of coronavirus, but it is only half of the equation. To suppress and control a pandemic of this magnitude, countries also must find and isolate every person infected with Covid-19 — including those with mild cases of the disease who don’t turn up in doctor’s offices or hospitals."
"4656","Washing our hands frequently and thoroughly is one of the simplest ways to limit the spread of Covid-19. Hands are responsible for carrying the majority of germs to your respiratory tract, so washing for 20 seconds and paying special attention to neglected areas like nails and thumbs can make a real difference. Dr. Morgan Rabach, a board-certified dermatologist and the co-founder of LM Medical NYC, typically washes her hands about 40 times throughout the day, including, of course, between each appointment. (Her favorite hand wash is Softsoap’s Antibacterial Liquid Hand Wash, though she notes that, in a pinch, “regular soap and water, if you are really scrubbing for 20 seconds, is just as good as an antibacterial soap.”)"
"4657","Annie Simeone and Armando Morales planned to get married sometime in the next month. They were just waiting for a day when both had off from their freelance jobs in film and TV production. Then, last Friday, they were told production had been suspended and they were out of work as a result of the new coronavirus pandemic."

So where can first-time buyers actually afford a home? A recent study sought to answer that question by considering the income of renters, who, after all, are prospective new owners."

"4671","The government’s relief bill doesn’t cover many McDonald’s workers. It’s time for the company to step up."
"4672","NEW DELHI — Over the weekend in Lucknow, one of India’s bigger cities, young people packed into pubs. Despite the Indian government scrambling to lock things down, few on the bar scene were taking the coronavirus very seriously."
"4673","We spend a lot of our days chatting with each other about things we see online, trying to make sense of it all. As everyone confronts the new coronavirus crisis, many of us are facing drastic changes, including illness, job loss and abandoning the office to work entirely from home.  "

"4683","PHYSICS FOR POETS Brian Greene is to science as Michael Lewis is to the financial world: He distills mountains of complicated information to a manageable size without dumbing it down. His fifth book, “Until the End of Time,” just spent three weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list. It opens with a punch to the gut — “In the fullness of time all that lives will die” — but goes on to strike a chord that is equal parts factual, thought-provoking and reassuring."

"4685","When it was released in theaters less than a month ago, “The Invisible Man” looked like a breakout hit with a topical twist: This modern-day adaptation of the H.G. Wells science-fiction novel tells the story of a Bay Area woman, played by Elisabeth Moss, whose abusive ex-boyfriend (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) has apparently committed suicide and left her a large sum of money. But when she tries to move forward, she is unable to convince others that her unseen ex might still be stalking her."
"4686","Nearly two months ago, when the new coronavirus was upending life in China, I felt for those living through this nightmare. As the news became more and more dire, I began worrying about the virus making its way to the United States. I cycled through anxieties about illness and quarantine, but my biggest fear was how my soon-to-be-ex-husband and I would handle this."

"4690","President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic has been a case study in a management style marked by falsehoods and intimidation.

"4691","In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders’s pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R.

"4737","Here’s the grimmest version of life a year from now: More than two million Americans have died from the new coronavirus, almost all mourned without funerals. Countless others have died because hospitals are too overwhelmed to deal adequately with heart attacks, asthma and diabetic crises. The economy has cratered into a depression, for fiscal and monetary policy are ineffective when people fear going out, businesses are closed and tens of millions of people are unemployed.

"4795","In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders’s pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s powerful support from older African-Americans could make him a resilient foe in South Carolina and beyond."
"4796","“IT’S NOT SO easy to live in my houses,” says the Italian artist and architect Vincenzo De Cotiis. Known as both an interior designer for his austere renovations (often of centuries-old palazzi) and as a furniture and object designer, the 61-year-old De Cotiis has a youthful rebelliousness in person that seems to contradict the seriousness of his work."
"4797","When it was released in theaters less than a month ago, “The Invisible Man” looked like a breakout hit with a topical twist: This modern-day adaptation of the H.G. Wells science-fiction novel tells the story of a Bay Area woman, played by Elisabeth Moss, whose abusive ex-boyfriend (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) has apparently committed suicide and left her a large sum of money. But when she tries to move forward, she is unable to convince others that her unseen ex might still be stalking her."
"4798","Nearly two months ago, when the new coronavirus was upending life in China, I felt for those living through this nightmare. As the news became more and more dire, I began worrying about the virus making its way to the United States. I cycled through anxieties about illness and quarantine, but my biggest fear was how my soon-to-be-ex-husband and I would handle this."
"4799","KIRKLAND, Wash. — Loretta Rapp, 79, was easy to spot as she zipped through the Life Care Center nursing home in her electric wheelchair, dressed in one of her bright muumuus."
"4800","While many couples around the world are canceling or postponing their weddings because of the coronavirus pandemic, some are scaling down their plans and getting married at home."
"4801","In the past two decades, coronaviruses have produced three deadly global epidemics: SARS, MERS and now Covid-19. If you’re wondering what it is about this family of viruses that makes it produce such deadly pathogens — and what about them might hinder their spread — here are a few things you should know."
"4802","As the heath care system strains to accommodate the unprecedented challenge of the coronavirus outbreak, many medical professionals on the front lines do not have adequate protection."
"4803","It’s clear that older people and those with health problems are most at risk of dying because of the coronavirus — but that doesn’t mean younger people who catch it won’t become gravely ill. Many already have."
"4804","Snowmen don’t last. Photos do. The camera’s ability to memorialize what is ephemeral is part of what makes the backyard sculptures of winter so photographable. We grow eager to freeze time when we realize a hard-earned creation won’t remain frozen for long."
"4805","FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank will begin an enormous new wave of bond purchases meant to counteract the “serious risks” to the eurozone caused by the coronavirus pandemic."

"4808","In a pandemic, apparently some people write “King Lear.” Me, I’m grateful just to read it. If you find yourself stuck in house arrest like Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov in “A Gentleman in Moscow” — and able to concentrate on something besides the news or your immediate mortal peril — you may want to stock up on books as well as canned beans. This week we recommend a story collection and four novels, including one by the Harlem Renaissance writer Claude McKay that was considered too edgy to publish during his lifetime. In nonfiction there’s a biography of the supremely unsettling novelist Robert Stone, two memoirs (one by a writer who suddenly stopped writing, and one about an extended Soviet family), as well as a weighty analysis of capitalism and politics by the best-selling economist Thomas Piketty. Download that to your e-reader, and you’ll have something to chew on for the next 18 months."
"4809","The coronavirus outbreak has prompted climate activists to abandon public demonstrations, one of their most powerful tools for raising public awareness, and shift to online protests."
"4810","PARIS — With the spread of the coronavirus accelerating at an alarming rate in France, President Emmanuel Macron addressed the nation Monday evening with a call for mobilization. Before millions of television viewers,  he looked directly into the camera and declared, “We are at war.” In 20 minutes, he said it six times."

The experience, she said, was dicier than, say, staying inside a New York apartment to avoid a dangerous virus, but there were some similarities, too."
"4813","SATURDAY PUZZLE — Longtime solvers will be glad to see Damon Gulczynski back on a weekend; it’s been about a year and a half, and he’s been a prolific constructor for The Times and a frequent contributor of tough stuff, which this puzzle certainly is."
"4814","It seemed like the most minor of mysteries, the kind a friend or spouse might indulge before gently changing the subject: A man who can’t remember the name or artist of a favorite song from his youth struggles to find either online."
"4815","The only thing that should have been different about the first Friday in March was the apple crisp. Heaven Frilot didn’t usually cook at the end of the workweek, instead letting her family snack on leftovers — a roast or pork chops she’d made earlier, maybe — or order pizza. But her 10-year-old son, Ethan, was having a friend over that night, and her husband, Mark, a lawyer, was coming off a crushing week of arbitration. She would bake an apple crisp."

"4821","With coronavirus threatening to overwhelm New York hospitals, state officials are considering turning landmark locations like the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into makeshift hospitals."
"4822",""
"4823","I’m not in a “La La Land” kind of mood. These strange times call for real life, so I found myself landing on “Strike a Pose.” Watching this 2016 documentary about the dancers who performed in Madonna’s “Blond Ambition” tour — one called it a show “about freedom, freedom as an artist, freedom as a human being” — the word I’m left with is resiliency."
"4824","Stephanie Turner adeptly performs the roles of writer, director and troubled lead in “Justine,” a bittersweet drama about a grieving widow who comes to care for a girl with spina bifida. Now streaming on Netflix, the movie is a tightly observed character study that thins out during more expositional moments, but it’s still a thoughtful tale of loneliness and its remedies."
"4825","Politicians, celebrities, social media influencers and even N.B.A. teams have been tested for the new coronavirus. But as that list of rich, famous and powerful people grows by the day, so do questions about whether they are getting access to testing that is denied to other Americans."
"4826","In the winter of 1942, shortly after Pearl Harbor was attacked, Edward Hopper began a new painting: a New York City diner at night, seen from outside, its four alienated inhabitants trapped behind a bubble of green glass. Of all Hopper’s paintings, “Nighthawks” encapsulates urban loneliness, the feeling of being unable to connect despite being surrounded by millions of others. Over the decades, it’s become so emblematic of this unhappy state that it’s regularly subject to parody. Sometimes the melancholy incumbents wear party hats; sometimes the diner floats in space. This week, a new version started circulating on social media. All the color had drained away. The people had vanished. The diner was empty."
"4827","“Coronavirus Racism Infected My High School” is a four-minute film that explores what happens when stereotypes and fear about Covid-19 arrive before the actual disease does? In this Opinion video, Katherine Oung, a 11th grader in Florida, shows what teenagers like her and her friends face as the coronavirus pandemic brings to the surface the racism underlying her community."
"4828","LONDON — Noël Coward wrote “Blithe Spirit” in a mere six days, and the perennially popular play opened on the West End in 1941, running for nearly 2,000 performances — setting a record in London for a nonmusical."

"4830","Straddling the line between advocacy documentary and D.I.Y. infomercial, “Dosed” promotes psychoactive vegetation as a potential cure for drug addiction. The filmmaker, Tyler Chandler, trails a friend, known in the film only by a first name, Adrianne, as she experiments with psilocybin mushrooms and the hallucinogenic plant iboga to treat her seemingly intractable dependence on heroin, methadone or morphine. The effectiveness of these alternative-medicine therapies, and the question of whether they should be legal, is still the subject of debate."
"4831","These charts show the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic in each country. New cases have dwindled in China and South Korea, but the virus continues to spread rapidly in most of the world."
"4832","ON DESPERATE GROUND: The Epic Story of Chosin Reservoir — the Greatest Battle of the Korean War, by Hampton Sides. (Anchor, 402 pp., $17.)

"4837","For Sharon Goldfarb, a nurse educator in California, crisis care is second nature: She worked at a Harlem H.I.V. clinic during the AIDS epidemic, at ground zero after Sept. 11 and in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. When the coronavirus outbreak began to spread, she was ready to prepare her 85 nursing students for front-line care, if necessary."
"4838","How does that Foo Fighters song go? “It’s times like these you learn to live again. It’s times like these you give and give again. It’s times like these you learn to love again. It’s times like these time and time again.” I feel like that is where we are — all pried out of our comfort zones and left to our own devices. I, for one, am using the telephone a lot more. Whatever you’re doing to get by, try to make some time for some great journalism."
"4839","KEY WEST, Fla. — In the end, said passengers who fled a cruise ship because of a coronavirus outbreak at sea, the evacuation and journey back to the United States was more harrowing, chaotic and frightening than their ill-fated maritime voyage."
"4840","We routinely differentiate between two kinds of military action: the inevitable carnage and collateral damage of diffuse hostilities, and the precision of a “surgical strike,” methodically targeted to the sources of our particular peril.

His interest in Memphis — a design collective formed in 1981 that placed an emphasis on bold colors and wild abstraction — stems in part from a fascination with the boundary-pushing aesthetics of that decade. In particular, Kirkwood is drawn to the graphic glass vases made by Ettore Sottsass, the Italian industrial designer and father of the postmodernist movement. “I found my first Sottsass vase about six years ago in Paris,” he says. “I was struck by its shape and color — it resembled something a child might build.” Since then, the 39-year-old has amassed a collection of over a dozen vases. Several are assembled on a windowsill in his Soho studio to catch the light, and a few contain the sculptural flower arrangements he prefers from London’s Fjura. “Sottsass pieces may not be practical or classically beautiful, but they can really hold a room,” says the designer, whose spring collection is inspired by the relationship between architecture and nature in Los Angeles. His recently redesigned website is now shoppable."

"4990","THE BANKER (2020) Stream on Apple TV Plus. Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson play men who join forces to subvert discriminatory housing practices in this historical drama. Set primarily before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the film begins by introducing Bernard S. Garrett (Mackie), an African-American entrepreneur who moves to Los Angeles along with his wife, Eunice (Nia Long). There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the city’s black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. “It’s hard not to root for them even if they’re obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film, Dargis wrote, “uses laughs, white racism and black righteousness to soft-sell a tale of inequality, heroic capitalism and eye-drooping mathematics.”"

Walker (Octavia Spencer), a daughter of formerly enslaved sharecroppers, who became America’s first female, self-made millionaire in the early 1900s. Born Sarah Breedlove, Walker started her journey as a sales person for a black hair care entrepreneur before breaking away to make her own products. She started out by selling them door-to-door and eventually grew her brand into an empire. Loosely based on the book “On Her Own Ground,” by Walker’s great-great-granddaughter A’Lelia Bundles, the show mostly concerns her later years and charts her obstacles with racial and gender biases. Critics have said the series suffers from clumsy storytelling, but it boasts noteworthy credits: Blair Underwood and Tiffany Haddish co-star, while Kasi Lemmons, the director of the Oscar-nominated biopic “Harriet,” is a director and executive producer."

But the form in which Emily Griffith is selling them is innovative. While living in Australia, she discovered sprouted buckwheat and created Lil Bucks, a company to make and sell the crunchy, earthy-tasting seeds. You can add them to granola, sprinkle them on salad, dust them over yogurt and so forth. Like so much these days, they’re billed as a “superfood,” but the real benefit is their fiber (5 grams in a quarter-cup), protein (6 grams in a quarter-cup), their nice texture and alluring flavor. In addition to plain, they also come flavored with matcha or cacao, neither of which add much in my view. Chunky clusters with other seeds and seasoned with chocolate or turmeric-lemon myrtle are for snacking."

"5463","SELF MADE: INSPIRED BY THE LIFE OF MADAM C.J. WALKER Stream on Netflix. If you’re looking to binge-watch your way through the weekend, consider this biographical, four-part series. “Self Made” centers on Madam C.J. Walker (Octavia Spencer), a daughter of formerly enslaved sharecroppers, who became America’s first female, self-made millionaire in the early 1900s. Born Sarah Breedlove, Walker started her journey as a sales person for a black hair care entrepreneur before breaking away to make her own products. She started out by selling them door-to-door and eventually grew her brand into an empire. Loosely based on the book “On Her Own Ground,” by Walker’s great-great-granddaughter A’Lelia Bundles, the show mostly concerns her later years and charts her obstacles with racial and gender biases. Critics have said the series suffers from clumsy storytelling, but it boasts noteworthy credits: Blair Underwood and Tiffany Haddish co-star, while Kasi Lemmons, the director of the Oscar-nominated biopic “Harriet,” is a director and executive producer."

These masks are not supposed to be reusable, but somehow I had to make it last: We didn’t have any more. I later learned that we only had 25 protective gowns — likewise designed to be single-use items — for an office of nine medical specialists. When I saw a delivery of protective medical equipment in our building the next day, I assumed it was for my office. Instead it was going to the lawyers’ office down the hall. We are finally getting 20 more masks, but our shortage remains acute."

But it eventually shifts focus to look at the adult lives of some of the camp’s alumni, several of whom became prominent activists.

The 12 overstuffed rooms, spread across three floors, are packed with Victorian and Art Nouveau-inspired details, such as Tiffany-style lamps and taxidermy, that feel in keeping with the buildings’ ornate crown moldings and pocket doors. But more eye-catching still are the fantastical nautical artifacts he collects, including a six-foot-long fiberglass alligator and a delicate paper replica of a coelacanth fish purchased from an Atlanta flea market. The foam-green and aquamarine painted walls are also covered in works by Wallacavage’s artist friends — in the parlor, inches from the Victorian wainscoting, is an original spray-painted tag by the Philadelphia graffiti artist Cornbread — and his own curbside finds.

"6025","A few days into social distancing, I learned my daughters’ school would be closed indefinitely. And as the school where I teach had crash-landed into its own eerie spring break, the walls of my house started to close in.

If you’ve always felt a particular type of movie was not for you, the goal is to change that."

In a land that is sharply unequal despite 26 years of democracy, money and whiteness feel especially concentrated here."

Set in April of the year it’s named for, “1917” stars Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay as a pair of British soldiers sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message to troops on the front line. Their journey, shot by Roger Deakins (who won an Oscar for his cinematography), is made to look as if it were filmed in a single long take. “The round-faced Chapman brings loose, affable charm to his role, while MacKay, a talented actor who’s all sharp angles, primarily delivers reactive intensity,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “This lack of nuance can be blamed on Mendes, who throughout seems far more interested in the movie’s machinery than in the human costs of war or the attendant subjects — sacrifice, patriotism and so on — that puff into view like little wisps of engine steam.”"

When Javier is forced to downsize his family from luxury digs back to a small apartment in a blue collar corner of Barcelona, his aspirational mantra mutates into malevolence toward the up-and-coming young patriarch Tomás (Mario Casas), who’s taken over the lease without realizing that the former resident still has a key to let himself in to use the bathroom (and worse)."

"6289","Four ways to measure the size of the outbreak across U.S. metro areas."
"6290","In 2010, a Costa Rican diplomat named Christiana Figueres set out to do something that many people saw as impossible. The United Nations had appointed her to build a global agreement to fight climate change. She needed to get 195 countries on board, and one of the biggest challenges was Saudi Arabia.

Alas, Javier’s decades-old tagline — “The life you deserve!” — no longer sells, according to his humiliating job interview with two hip marketers who make him feel as musty as the bottom of a work space kombucha keg. When Javier is forced to downsize his family from luxury digs back to a small apartment in a blue collar corner of Barcelona, his aspirational mantra mutates into malevolence toward the up-and-coming young patriarch Tomás (Mario Casas), who’s taken over the lease without realizing that the former resident still has a key to let himself in to use the bathroom (and worse)."

The 12 overstuffed rooms, spread across three floors, are packed with Victorian and Art Nouveau-inspired details, such as Tiffany-style lamps and taxidermy, that feel in keeping with the buildings’ ornate crown moldings and pocket doors. But more eye-catching still are the fantastical nautical artifacts he collects, including a six-foot-long fiberglass alligator and a delicate paper replica of a coelacanth fish purchased from an Atlanta flea market. The foam-green and aquamarine painted walls are also covered in works by Wallacavage’s artist friends — in the parlor, inches from the Victorian wainscoting, is an original spray-painted tag by the Philadelphia graffiti artist Cornbread — and his own curbside finds. In the kitchen, a mint-condition sign from the iconic local business Bambi Cleaners, fished from the trash, looks down from atop an ivory-painted 1940s-era cabinet."

White, 50, who was tasked with designing this compact space on Orchard Street last spring.

After all, says White, “that’s when we spend the most time at home — at night.” For this project, White stuck to his druthers, making lighting a key component in what became an atmospheric oasis that recalls both the minimalism and the glamour of the ’70s."

The art critic, self-proclaimed “failed artist” and winner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for criticism is weathering the pandemic with his wife, the Times art critic Roberta Smith, in northwestern Connecticut. Thankfully, he has some words of wisdom for cooped-up people looking to put their nervous energy to good use:"

"6573","At a time of global crisis, it can be comforting to remember that, in Los Angeles, waves still break on the Santa Monica beaches, though the usual beachcombers are staying home.

"6578","In the age of Google, when practically every recipe imaginable is just a few clicks away, real-life cookbooks are often relegated to a crowded shelf or tossed into the “donate” pile. Now that many of us are stuck at home, perhaps it’s time to dust off (or buy) a good old-fashioned cookbook and dirty the pages by cooking something from it. If you’re in the market, here are the cookbooks Food reporters and editors love for the most reliable results."
"6579","WASHINGTON — So much has changed so quickly for Joseph Palma that he barely recognizes his life."
"6580","Donald Trump’s re-election strategy had two potential paths this week. The first path would save millions of jobs, turn Trump into a populist hero for many and perhaps prevent another depression. The second path would court chaos, playing up the partisan divide, deflecting all blame for the coronavirus pandemic onto the media, China and the Obama White House, and praying that it ends up being enough to obscure his administration’s disastrous lack of preparation."
"6581","Not so long ago, I had a face-to-face coffee with someone who had assured me over email that she was “undaunted and free of symptoms.” Symptoms of what, she did not have to specify. The coronavirus was far enough along for that to be implied — though not so far along that it couldn’t be joked about, and joke we did, looking out at an empty street, with an empty bar stool between us."

"6603","My most prominent memory from the Persian Gulf war was realizing my brother is a stone-cold genius. I was 10, he 5. We lived in Riyadh at the time, and our nightly routine included waking up to blaring air-raid sirens. The family would stumble down to the “bunker,” a large storage closet under the stairs. There we strapped on our gas masks, tried to get some rest on the floor and then crawled back up to bed at dawn."
"6604","Niani Barracks usually tends to clients at a salon in Detroit, but now that she must stay indoors because of the coronavirus pandemic, she has instead been running her fingers through the hair of a mannequin head affixed to a stand in her home, as a dozen other black women watch her online."
"6605","A concrete-ceilinged two-room apartment on the fourth floor of an 11-story building on Manhattan’s Lower East Side gets little natural light — very little. But this didn’t prove particularly daunting for the New York- and Los Angeles-based interior designer Alex P. White, 50, who was tasked with designing this compact space on Orchard Street last spring. White, who trained as an artist before working with the acclaimed interior designer Kelly Behun and then going out on his own three years ago, favors dark, moody lighting anyway; his Instagram page is filled with vintage photos of interiors that, unlike the bright rooms seen in home magazines today, were taken after sundown. After all, says White, “that’s when we spend the most time at home — at night.” For this project, White stuck to his druthers, making lighting a key component in what became an atmospheric oasis that recalls both the minimalism and the glamour of the ’70s."

"6607","With increasing numbers of people now working from home, it has become clear that we each fall into one of two camps: those who dress up for their working day — think: makeup, jewelry and real pants — and those who favor workout clothes and blankets. Regardless of this divide, video conference calls have become a near unavoidable reality and require a certain level of decorum — at least from the waist up. Luckily, the past few years have seen a surge in brands offering fashion-forward loungewear that can bridge the public-private gap with designs that are both comfortable and presentable. Below, a selection of labels that cater to every level of low-maintenance dressing, with pieces from luxurious knits to sophisticated sweats."

Many of us have been cooking like mad, to keep from going mad. That’s a comfort to some, but not all. “Please, God,” wrote The Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan on Twitter the other day, “someone do a sport so my boyfriend will stop talking about his sourdough starter.”"

I’m doing a few posts for Deb, which is rocking my tiny routine right now — it is appalling how quickly I’ve settled into a stream of 24-hour periods with absolutely no variation.

Excellent flash-frozen pizzas shipped directly from Naples, which were first sold in New York a year ago, are now available for delivery nationwide. The 11-inch pizzas, from Talia di Napoli, come with assorted toppings, and also plain or just cheese for your own creations. Eight to 10 minutes in the oven is all it takes to go from freezer to table."

"7502","Édouard Louis opened the door to the apartment at the top of the Tour Perret, the only skyscraper in the northern French city of Amiens. He said hello warmly before resuming his position in front of a large window, which looked onto a boulevard that cut through town and then vanished into green fields. The apartment belonged to someone called Noppe, who must have been an amateur artist and collector with a nostalgic idea of globe-trotting. On one wall hung a painting that bore the owner’s name, which somewhat stereotypically depicted four African masks suspended in a cloud of hieroglyphs; across from it stood a display case containing regional glassware and a number of vintage die-cast cars. Louis was in the midst of a preliminary shoot for a documentary with the working title “Édouard Louis, or the Transformation,” and the filmmaker, François Caillat, had rented the apartment for its views. “Now you have Amiens at your feet,” Caillat said. “When you arrived, it wasn’t like that.”"
