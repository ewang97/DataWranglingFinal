The first: a cheeky approach to the Beethoven-theme concerts that almost every ensemble seems to be planning this year to coincide with the 250th anniversary of his birth.

"24","With the price of one 30-second ad during Super Bowl LIV rising to as much as $5.6 million, some movie studios sat on the sidelines this year. Others bought time on the more affordable pregame show (where spots cost $2 to $3 million). Still, over the course of Super Sunday, spots were unveiled for 10 films, including “F9: The Fast Saga,” which had debuted a longer clip on Friday, and “Minions: The Rise of Gru,” which will release its first full trailer on Wednesday.

A few minutes into Nick Mecikalski’s timely, if somewhat by the numbers, satire “Really Really Gorgeous,” we learn that a catastrophic flood has left Washington, the entire Pacific time zone and New York City underwater."
"32","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Kansas City Chiefs stormed back for a ridiculous 31-20 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl, reeling off three touchdowns in just over five minutes to overwhelm one of the N.F.L.’s most dominant defenses.

"50","Alas, no one ever lost money betting on the cynicism of today’s congressional Republicans. On Friday evening, Republican senators voted in near lock step to block testimony from any new witnesses or the production of any new documents, a vote that was tantamount to an acquittal of the impeachment charges against President Trump.

The 18-year-old pop singer Billie Eilish, who took home five trophies from last week’s Grammy Awards, including for best new artist, is featured in this hourlong concert. Her set list is largely made up of songs from her debut album, “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” (which won album of the year), including the dark, assertive pop hits “Bad Guy” and “You Should See Me In a Crown.” Popular singles like “Ocean Eyes” are featured as well. Though she is a young artist, Eilish has been redefining the pop music genre for years, Jon Pareles wrote for The New York Times, saying that “she’s sullen, depressive, death-haunted, sly, analytical and confrontational, all without raising her voice.”"
"56","SATURDAY PUZZLE — Mark Diehl is a weekend fixture with a consistent style: open grids with low word counts, both traits that are easily recognizable and intimidating. These puzzles tend to be more difficult to solve because there are fewer “bits of tape” holding them together, meaning short fill that tends to be guessable. They are also quite intricate feats of construction that require a deft touch to keep the sparkle alive and the clunkers away."

"67","Just when you’d like your next cookbook to transport you to a beach lounge, tall drink in hand, along comes “Beyond the North Wind” by Darra Goldstein, a writer and scholar whose specialty is Russian food, to show “how a harsh climate, poor soil and limited availability of foods” can inspire a cuisine that suits our time. This beautifully photographed and personal cookbook explores Russia on a road to discovery beyond fancy czarist dishes and clichés like chicken Kiev. It’s part travelogue, not that you are likely to book a trip to Kola Peninsula, which juts into the Barents Sea. And it’s timely, covering foods like whole grains, fermented dairy, vegetables and herbs, often foraged. Try the creamy fermented oatmeal or a savory pie in rye dough, with scallion and egg filling, for brunch; mushroom barley soup, braised cod with horseradish, and stroganina, frozen fish to serve in thin shavings for dinner with homemade infused vodka. Recipes for kasha, blini, pelmeni, and venison meatballs, with celery root and mushrooms, are also covered."

Now it will be onstage presented by the Peccadillo Theater Company and Close Quarter Productions. Called “Sideways the Experience,” it was adapted by Rex Pickett, the author of the book, and for some ticket-holders, the performance will include a food  and wine tasting (merlot included) by the caterer Mary Giuliani onstage before the show begins, as well as wines — selected and provided by Wine Access — to sip during the performance."
"69","Aperitif liqueurs, both imported and domestic, continue to gain in popularity. Select, an example from Venice that’s been around for 100 years, hit the American market late last summer, and, with its ruby color, suits a Valentine toast. The blend of botanicals includes a good dose of juniper and was created by the brothers Mario and Vittorio Pilla. It’s a touch mellower than some of its competitors and is a key ingredient in the spritz, made like most with three parts Prosecco, two of Select and a spray of soda water, but distinguished in Venice by the addition of a big fat green olive."

The second who faced impeachment covered up the wiretapping and break-in at the opposing party’s headquarters. The third disgraced president had an affair with a White House intern, and then lied about it."
"100","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The years since the Chiefs’ last Super Bowl victory have felt like decades and the decades like centuries in the Kansas City area, where season after season ended in emotional wreckage.

"101","Q: I own a co-op in Brooklyn that’s worth about $450,000. I would like to take some equity out of the apartment for other uses, but my options seem limited.

After many checkpoints, where officers shake down the young men on motorbikes, some riding two or three at a time, their thin arms curled around each other’s waists, you’ll see a silty brown river snaking past men lounging on charpoys by its banks. On the way, if you admire the fields of sugarcane, each stalk taller than a man, your driver, a local who has played under the green sway of these plants as a child, will scoff. The ganna is short this year because there has been little water. He has seen these plants soar to fifteen feet.

Unlike some performers married to each other, they have plenty of onscreen chemistry — his happy-go-lucky manner rubbing against her more sober guardedness.

In Paolo Sorrentino’s “The New Pope,” a new episode of which airs tonight at 9 p.m. on HBO, the line between the sacred and the profane is vanishingly thin. The Roman Catholic Church, as Sorrentino presents it, is a throbbing tangle of contradictions where spirituality and corruption coexist in flamboyant contradiction, often within its individual members. Desire, he indicates, is omnipresent, but its object takes many different forms. This film covers similar territory in much the same way but on a greater scale. Its protagonist, Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is an aging, hedonistic journalist who undertakes a journey to discover authentic beauty and give up its many alluring counterfeits."

Recipes for kasha, blini, pelmeni, and venison meatballs, with celery root and mushrooms, are also covered."

The film and television side is packed with comic-book adaptations (“Watchmen”), horror (“The Haunting of Hill House”), thrillers (“Karen Sisco”) and sci-fi (“Wayward Pines”). The theater side lists plays by the likes of Tennessee Williams, Eugene O’Neill and Athol Fugard. Who else straddles such a wide range? We’ll wait."

The competition pits teams from around the country against one another in a variety of brick-building challenges. The contestants’ first assignment: to create a model theme park. Their time limit? 15 hours. The prize for winning the competition at large is $100,000 — though surely any contestants who make it through without stepping on a brick can be considered successful."

In Paolo Sorrentino’s “The New Pope,” a new episode of which airs tonight at 9 p.m. on HBO, the line between the sacred and the profane is vanishingly thin. The Roman Catholic Church, as Sorrentino presents it, is a throbbing tangle of contradictions where spirituality and corruption coexist in flamboyant contradiction, often within its individual members. Desire, he indicates, is omnipresent, but its object takes many different forms. This film covers similar territory in much the same way but on a greater scale. Its protagonist, Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is an aging, hedonistic journalist who undertakes a journey to discover authentic beauty and give up its many alluring counterfeits."

I’m positive that the restaurant was very fancy — fancy enough that the servers wore white gloves. And fanciful enough that the last of the courses was bonbons of many colors, wheeled out on a trolley that could have held a royal wedding cake.

"534","In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in mid-January, Hillary Clinton said she considered Bernie Sanders unaccomplished and unlikable, with few friends on Capitol Hill.

"535","As a child of immigrants, a grandchild of refugees, a Deaf woman of color, an artist and a mother, I was proud to perform the national anthem and “America the Beautiful” in American Sign Language at the opening of the Super Bowl on Sunday. I accepted the invitation to represent the National Association of the Deaf in partnership with the National Football League because I wanted to express my patriotism and honor the country that I am proud to be from — a country that, at its core, believes in equal rights for all citizens, including those with disabilities.

They exhibit masterly ease in the style they call West Coast urban dance, with the quick precision to register a pop song’s every beat. As choreographers, they are clever and inventive but also sweet and sincere in their storytelling."
"549","THE GREAT BEAUTY (2013) Stream on the Criterion Channel. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In Paolo Sorrentino’s “The New Pope,” a new episode of which airs tonight at 9 p.m. on HBO, the line between the sacred and the profane is vanishingly thin. The Roman Catholic Church, as Sorrentino presents it, is a throbbing tangle of contradictions where spirituality and corruption coexist in flamboyant contradiction, often within its individual members. Desire, he indicates, is omnipresent, but its object takes many different forms. This film covers similar territory in much the same way but on a greater scale. Its protagonist, Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is an aging, hedonistic journalist who undertakes a journey to discover authentic beauty and give up its many alluring counterfeits."

He has spent the evening at a casino and now it’s approaching midnight, but the card game has left Léonce “in high spirits, and very talkative.” He wakes his wife to gossip but she answers him sleepily, “with little half utterances.” Spurned, and still intent on rousing her, Léonce manufactures a fever for their sleeping son. When Edna dares doubt this, Léonce calls her a bad mother. She springs out of bed to check, while Léonce — no longer worried, if he ever actually was — enjoys his cigar. Soon, Mr. Pontellier is fast asleep, but “Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake.”"

A year and a half ago, Gandhi added New Haven to his weekly peregrinations — he was teaching a seminar at the Yale School of Architecture called Where the Wild Things Are, after Maurice Sendak’s 1963 children’s book. For the final project of the semester, the professor took his class to the wind-swept island of Cape Breton (a glove-shaped appendage separated from Nova Scotia’s main peninsula by the narrow Strait of Canso) to visit Rabbit Snare Gorge — his 2013 project with the New York-based architecture firm Design Base 8 — a slender cabin that stretches 43 feet tall, like a 16th-century Mannerist portrait. Touring the surrounding plot, a 47-acre wooded slope bisected by the creek that gives the house its name, Gandhi, 40, asked his students to conceive a “campus of creatures” — a set of structures that, as he described it when we met at his Halifax studio last summer, “have an attitude and respond and look like they move.”"
"688","Last August, at a premiere party at the NeueHouse on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, the actor Brian Michael Smith was biting into a slider when he turned around and there was Oprah Winfrey. Several years before, as a black transgender man struggling to break into Hollywood, Smith saw no obvious trajectory to a meaningful career. Even a college acting teacher said no one would cast him. “I saw zero representation of transmasculinity,” he says, using an umbrella term that means different things to different people but often describes trans men and nonbinary people who identify more with masculinity. “It was very isolating to grow up and have these dreams.

Midway through a wild brawl, the bubbly criminal-turned-mercenary Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) sees her ally Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) struggling as her long hair gets in her eyes. Harley slides over and gives her a hair tie, and they get back to knocking down goons. Batman may have a lot in his utility belt, but definitely not a hair tie."

I’m positive that the restaurant was very fancy — fancy enough that the servers wore white gloves. And fanciful enough that the last of the courses was bonbons of many colors, wheeled out on a trolley that could have held a royal wedding cake. There must have been chocolates and lollipops and squares of pâte de fruits (gummy bears’ ritzy relatives), but I had eyes only for the tall, glass, footed apothecary jars with lids shaped like the Kremlin’s pointy domes."

"1127","How does corporate capitalism imagine the human soul? As a nuisance? An opportunity? Collateral damage? A blob of molten plastic to be injected into a minion-­shaped mold? One of the funniest answers to this question comes from the comedian Conner O’Malley, who has built a career playacting the way consumerism warps our spirits. Out on the street, he has recorded dozens of videos in which he plays, basically, capitalism’s hype man — a loudmouthed white dude-bro who is perpetually awed by advertising and luxury goods. He will rush up to anyone who looks rich — men in suits, men driving ostentatious cars — and slather them with over-­the-­top compliments that lean heavily on the word “pimp.” “Oh, hell yeah, pimp!” he shouts into a convertible. When a Hummer stops near him, O’Malley rushes toward its open window: “Man, you’re a job creator, you’re a pimp, you’re an angel, and I love you forever!” His brain seems full of targeted ads. He accosts a businessman on a cellphone: “Dude, what’s up? Maxim Magazine, am I right?” Sometimes O’Malley’s circuitry seems to misfire, but there is no time to stop and think — he will stand in front of a Mustang and chant: “Steroids! Steroids! Steroids!”"

He has spent the evening at a casino and now it’s approaching midnight, but the card game has left Léonce “in high spirits, and very talkative.” He wakes his wife to gossip but she answers him sleepily, “with little half utterances.” Spurned, and still intent on rousing her, Léonce manufactures a fever for their sleeping son. When Edna dares doubt this, Léonce calls her a bad mother. She springs out of bed to check, while Léonce — no longer worried, if he ever actually was — enjoys his cigar. Soon, Mr. Pontellier is fast asleep, but “Mrs. Pontellier was by that time thoroughly awake.”"

One of the works in the stack is a self-portrait created last summer during a residency hosted by the Milan gallery Martina Simeti that shows the artist reclining with flushed cheeks, her face clouded by a rosy blot of pink watercolor, and surrounded by floating gemlike cells rendered in vibrant azure blue. “I was seeing all these bugs, so I started studying bugs incessantly and learning all their names in Italian,” she says. “This is how my work goes.

"1404","Turquoise waters, delicious seafood, colorful snorkeling and white sand: There are a lot of places in the Caribbean that have all these wonderful things, but Curaçao is one place you might not have discovered. Sandwiched between Aruba and Bonaire, and a short boat ride from the Venezuelan coast, Curaçao is bigger than its island neighbors and packed with memorable treasures for enterprising travelers to discover. Of the Dutch West Indies, Curaçao may very well be the most Dutch; the island’s capital, Willemstad, looks like a colorful mini Amsterdam, and Curaçao’s currency is called the guilder, the former currency of the Netherlands (though United States dollars are readily accepted across the island). Restaurant menus often feature both bitterballen (fried Dutch meatballs) and kabritu stoba (Antillean goat stew), and when the Dutch soccer teams play, the bars are packed with orange shirts drinking Heineken and speaking Papiamento, the local language. Amid this blended culture is a beach hopper’s dream, and the best way to enjoy everything the island offers is by renting a car and roaming the island’s roads until you find the perfect blue cove."

Alison Brie — who co-wrote this film with its director, Jeff Baena — plays Sarah, an unassuming and socially awkward arts-and-crafts store employee who doesn’t quite fit in with her Zumba classmates or her roommate. Despite this, she finds comfort in her favorite TV show, “Purgatory,” and in visiting a horse she used to own — both of which seem to protect her from the world’s harsh realities, including her mother’s death and her grandmother’s psychosis. Then, Sarah begins to spiral. In what is a clear mental health decline, Sarah finds herself entangled in a web of amnesia, hallucinations and supernatural experiences. “It would be tactful, at this point, for ‘Horse Girl’ to show how Sarah’s hallucinations are causing her suffering; instead, it indulges them,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review for The New York Times. She added, “The more time we spend inside her visions, the more we are invited to enable her, to shrug off our worry in favor of an absorbing paranormal mystery.”"

Most don’t, I think, but among those who did, there’s always the question of how, if at all, to bring up the subject in mixed company, whether in the hopes of eliciting either laughter or shock, followed by sexual intrigue mixed with pity. It’s easy enough to sell out an evangelical Christian childhood, and plenty of other pens have been given over to the subject of whether it’s a good idea to raise children in the expectation of being swept up by the Raisin Bran scoop of heaven; I have no wish to dwell on the question of whether I ought to have been taught about the Rapture. No one consulted me beforehand, and I can’t see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs – it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talk’s cover of “I Wish We’d All Been Ready” sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood."

He has introduced four braising sauces, two for quick stir-fries and two for slower simmers; each comes with a simple recipe based on one of the restaurant’s dishes, usually using at least half the jar of sauce. For many seasoning purposes, I liked the nubbly, spicy-sweet chile caramel sauce, recommended for a shrimp stir-fry, but superb with eggplant, chicken or pork belly. The Claypot Chicken quick-braising sauce and Lo Soi Pork sauce for a slow braise were dark, fairly thin and spicy. The ruddy, viscous Vietnamese French braising sauce was quite sweet and to me, less appealing than the others."

Lara Jean swoons over one-off classics like “The Breakfast Club” and “Sixteen Candles” (even as she concedes Long Duk Dong is “extremely racist”).

"2184","In food, fermentation — the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates — is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December’s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city’s diversity of dwellers that he’d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier’s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book “Critical Booch.”)"

Most don’t, I think, but among those who did, there’s always the question of how, if at all, to bring up the subject in mixed company, whether in the hopes of eliciting either laughter or shock, followed by sexual intrigue mixed with pity. It’s easy enough to sell out an evangelical Christian childhood, and plenty of other pens have been given over to the subject of whether it’s a good idea to raise children in the expectation of being swept up by the Raisin Bran scoop of heaven; I have no wish to dwell on the question of whether I ought to have been taught about the Rapture. No one consulted me beforehand, and I can’t see why I should be asked to provide an opinion on the subject now. I was roughly as afraid of the Rapture as I was of being the last person in the house who left the basement at nighttime and had to turn the lights out before I went up the stairs – it felt variously real and ridiculous depending on how close I was to being alone. Afternoons where I was the first person to come home after school and the neighborhood seemed slightly emptier than usual were ideal for Rapture practice, for seeing if I could gin up sufficient panic and remorse at the prospect of being unscooped; playing DC Talk’s cover of “I Wish We’d All Been Ready” sometimes helped, but more often than not just made me even more self-conscious of having to trick myself into getting in the mood."

But for the past 10 years, Yuskavage, 57, has made the daily journey to a quiet corner of Gowanus, Brooklyn, where she keeps her studio, a cavernous 4,000-square-foot space in a low-rise brick building that she has cleaved down the middle with a 40-foot-long wall. She compares the two sides to the two halves of her brain. In the back room, spare and suffused with northern light, Dionysian Lisa lets her “id run amok” on the canvas; in the bookshelf-lined front room, Apollonian Lisa — “rational, logical, organized” — tends to the big business of being a successful contemporary artist. “I have to be pretty un-self-conscious when I’m working,” Yuskavage says one January afternoon. “And then later I become extremely conscious.”"

"2303","THE FAREWELL (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. While it may not have garnered any Academy Award nominations, this comedic drama from Lulu Wang netted a Golden Globe for its star, Awkwafina, and was among the highest-grossing indie movies of 2019. Based on an experience from Wang’s own life (or, as the film puts it, “based on an actual lie”), “The Farewell” casts Awkwafina as Billi, a young, creative New Yorker who learns that her overseas grandmother (played by Zhao Shuzhen) has a terminal illness. Billi travels with her parents to the northern Chinese city of Changchun, where her grandmother lives, but not before reluctantly agreeing to terms set by the rest of the family: Nobody is permitted to tell the matriarch about her illness. What follows is a bittersweet story that plumbs family relationships and cultural differences. The film “has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. “Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone.”"

This sequel begins with a happy solo dance in front of a mirror. Based on a young adult novel by Jenny Han and heavily inspired by teenage comedies of the 1980s, the movie became a streaming hit when it debuted in 2018. The sequel continues the story of the teenagers Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose happily-ever-after ends up being complicated by the fact that, well, they’re in high school, and they’re human. “When dealing with a franchise, especially one that was as successful as the first film, you really want to follow up with something that isn’t just exactly what the audience would want,” Centineo said in a recent interview with The New York Times. But they also obviously want the new recipe to spark the same kind of joy that the original did in its devotees. Or, as Centineo put it: “Chicken soup for the soul, baby. That’s what we want.”"

Two women, Dani Núñez and Sophie Suarez, gape at the elaborately carved ceiling, 24-karat fixtures and lavish chandeliers. Recently engaged, they are touring potential wedding venues with their families. Dani’s father, a wealthy businessman, had suggested this one. At one point, Sophie’s mom wonders aloud, nervously, if she should have dressed up for the appointment. But no matter: The mood is festive, giddy. As they are led into a sprawling ballroom, Sophie’s abuela looks around skeptically and asks: “Where does the food go? Because we need a few tables to put everything we’re bringing.” The hotel event planner, blond hair pulled back into a pristine twist, informs her that the hotel doesn’t allow outside food, her voice barely concealing her disdain."

"2745","In food, fermentation — the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates — is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December’s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city’s diversity of dwellers that he’d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier’s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book “Critical Booch.”)"

At its starting point, atop the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, the trail is marked with notices reminding hikers that the path is without water and that “what goes down must go back up.” After a stretch of steep switchbacks drops you a quarter mile into the canyon’s rim, a sign advises not to try the walk to and from the Colorado River, which cuts across the canyon’s floor, in a single day. In four languages, it cautions against the steep, exposed 12-mile hike, but it’s the illustration — of a muscular blond hiker, burned red and projectile vomiting on all fours — that most succinctly communicates the message."

"2783","Last spring, days after news reports revealed the English soccer champion Manchester City was facing expulsion from the Champions League, European soccer’s governing body confirmed the club was indeed in danger.

"2785","In addition to being obvious testaments to beauty, flowers are often bound up in human ritual. We give blooms to note a birth, a death and many occasions in between, including the, well, blossoming, of romantic love. At a certain point, though, we long for something more surprising and complex than the single stems of roses and carnations that we might have given to middle school crushes. Here are nine stories that show how else one might think about or use flowers (or even weeds), from turning them into sculptural headdresses to incorporating them into a home-cooked meal — on Valentine’s Day or otherwise."
"2786","I met the man who became my husband at a book party in a downtown loft in late spring. In retrospect, meeting that way was auspicious, an indication of a shared passion, if not for the particular book being feted that evening — one about the dawning gig economy that has long since been surpassed by bleaker fare — than for books in general. But at the time, I wanted nothing to do with him."

It is time for that to end for a player whose record 4,256 hits and 15,890 plate appearances may never be equaled."
"2792","In food, fermentation — the process by which enzymes from microorganisms break down carbohydrates — is both an ancient practice and a recent trend. Cheese, made from cultured milk, was being produced in present-day Iraq around 7,000 B.C., and the Chinese are thought to have started making sake from fermented rice a couple of millenniums later. Over the past decade, chefs and diners have been drawn to all manner of fermented produce, as well as to fermented staples like kombucha and kimchi, sourdough and cider, for their tangy flavors and presumed digestive health benefits. Perhaps surprisingly, so have artists, though for their own reasons. In response to a report that a Chinese factory was making soy sauce out of fermented hair, the Miami-based artist Nicolas Lobo fermented some of his own in 2012. During last December’s Faena Festival, part of Miami Art Week, the installation artist Emeka Ogboh served a craft ale with notes of lime and pepper meant to nod to the city’s diversity of dwellers that he’d brewed in the hopes of sparking conversation about immigration and globalization. And Arden Surdam, who lives in Los Angeles and works primarily in photography, is currently collaborating with microbiologists from University of California, San Diego, to develop a bioreactor that will use fermentation to desaturate the pigmentation and decrease the potency of harmful algae blooms. (Also see the Toronto-based curator Lauren Fournier’s ongoing series examining fermentation through a feminist lens, which led to the 2019 book “Critical Booch.”)"

On the north island of Hokkaido, Niseko includes four main separate, but linked, resorts (collectively called Niseko United). Beyond the slopes, the island is renowned for world-class seafood, produce and beef as well as beer, whiskey and even some sake. Its excellent restaurants, from simple noodle bars and laid-back izakayas (Japanese pubs) to fine dining at the Michelin-starred Kamimura, spotlight the island’s bounty. Though often called the Aspen of Asia — and, indeed, Niseko is undergoing a similar luxury building boom — this Japanese resort is forging its own identity, from design to food to culture and wellness scenes."

"2853","It’s tempting to call the author Richie Jackson’s new book, “Gay Like Me,” a memoir or an epistolary — but it’s really a manifesto, a 156-page letter from a gay 54-year-old father to his gay 19-year-old son, Jackson Wong, about what it meant to be gay when the writer was young in New York and what it means to be gay now. In that way, the work is a magnanimous gesture of generational transference: a cheat sheet on queer history; a lecture about safe sex; a call to get angry, harness one’s otherness and ultimately claim individuality. But it’s also one man’s personal history, a timeline of decades spent pursuing fatherhood as well his (nonbiological) L.G.B.T.Q. family at large."

"2913","On Valentine’s Day in 1970, David Mancuso hosted a private party called Love Saves the Day in his loft at 647 Broadway in New York, a few blocks north of Houston Street. He was an audio obsessive with a voracious appetite for spiritual sounds and a profound sense of community, and the event was an opportunity to bring together friends in a setting unfettered by commercial demands, or the restrictions of their outside lives."
"2914","Politically, 2020 has been, so far, a gonzo variety show of executive howlers and hissy fits; prayer breakfasts and Iowa pratfalls; split “victories” and revenge firings. The weirdness overload has almost seemed staged to distract from other American realities: migrant detention centers, corporate land grabs, climate catastrophe and the cruelties of poverty and racism. All of which makes the arrival at the New Museum of “Peter Saul: Crime and Punishment,” a critically acidic dirty bomb of a show, well-timed."

"2966","Among the many special causes entrusted to the patronage of St. Valentine — beekeeping, love — is epilepsy, though no one seems to know exactly why. The great 20th-century psychiatrist Leo Kanner guessed in a 1930 paper on epileptic folklore that the association was earned by the similarity between the sound of Valentine’s name spoken in German and the epithet “fallende Sucht,” “the falling disease.” It may have been that over time, entreaties to Valentine from epileptics were answered with particular generosity. They needed all the help they could get. Kanner cites several other saints known to be patrons of epilepsy, whose names were given over time as euphemisms for the disease — St. John, St. Donato, St. Cornelius and scores more."

My husband was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He is undergoing treatment, but we face a very uncertain financial future. I would now like to keep the entire estate. My niece is doing well financially, with many earning years ahead of her, unlike me. Is there a way to tell her I’ve changed my mind so she won’t hate me forever?"

"3222","“Downhill” is a vacation-gone-wrong comedy that lives up to its ill-advised title. It stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell as a couple on an Alpine ski trip, which is not the worst premise. They bicker and blunder within the parameters of their familiar comic personas, and you almost believe that their characters (Billie and Pete) could actually be married. He is a needy, amiable, slightly hysterical doofus. She is impatient and anxious. Their twin preadolescent sons (Julian Grey and Ammon Ford) barely have personalities at all, but as the family arrives in Austria it seems possible that the audience will have a good time even if the characters don’t."

Have you been to the edge of the universe?” In the Old Testament, The Voice from the Whirlwind poses these questions to Job. The implied answer is no, for these seem to be divine prerogatives. For humans, heaven is a gated community, and we typically can’t even peer through. This is one reason (among many) near-death experiences inspire awe: They seem to give us a “God’s eye” view of what really lies beyond. They take us to the edge of the universe."

Steve McQueen plays a millionaire who robs banks for fun, and Faye Dunaway is the insurance investigator on his tail. There is something downright intoxicating about the two stars’ charisma, and their chemistry feels as inexorable as tectonic plates moving toward each other. When they engage in a game of chess — a real one, though the metaphorical aspect is also there — you might have to fan yourself. Michel Legrand’s alternately lush and driving score is a gem of its own. ELISABETH VINCENTELLI"

"3746","When the choreographer George Balanchine debuted “Jewels” in 1967 at the New York City Ballet’s new home at Lincoln Center, it was considered the first full-evening abstract ballet. Cynics speculated that, with sparkly costumes and three acts titled “Emeralds,” “Rubies” and “Diamonds,” he was trying to attract a glitzier crowd for the relatively proletarian dance company. But he insisted his inspiration came from the gems in the Fifth Avenue windows of Van Cleef & Arpels, the Parisian jeweler run by Claude Arpels. Claude’s uncle, Louis, had been the first Arpels to recognize the elegant symbiosis between gems and the ballet, commissioning the now 124-year-old maison’s signature ballerina clips in the 1940s. Van Cleef & Arpels has continued to reference dance throughout its history, most recently with these earrings made in the dangling rounded-pendant balletti style, inspired by the jewel-toned ball gowns worn by women during the Italian Renaissance. While both pairs feature diamonds and pearls, one suggests spring, with a confection of rubies and pink sapphires, and the other gestures toward fall, with emeralds, yellow sapphires and black spinels. Both dance and spin weightlessly in the light, alive with effervescent grace. Price on request, vancleefarpels.com."
"3747","While some designers have lately adopted rigid sculptural silhouettes in their collections, others have taken that same penchant for volume and turned it toward looser, easier pieces. Take, for example, Valentino’s spring 2020 collection, in which a series of crisp white looks with wide skirts and exaggerated puff sleeves gave way to billowy floor-grazing tiered dresses in vibrant fuchsia, orange and chartreuse. Jil Sander’s Luke and Lucie Meier and Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri, by contrast, created drama with multidimensional textiles adorned with fringe or straw. To capture these collections, and some of the season’s other most kinetic looks, the photographer Johnny Dufort and stylist Jane How chose fittingly spectacular settings: the fantastical rooms of the Italian art hotel Atelier Sul Mare and Sicily’s northern coast. There, the waves, the flash of the camera and the dresses (as well as a few separates) came together to create images that are constantly in motion."

To create the works, the 65-year-old artist provides written or illustrated instructions for viewers, inviting them to pose with wooden furniture, plastic buckets or ballpoint pens in unusual, sometimes physically strenuous, positions. The resulting contortions, which Wurm records in photographs, are at once humorous and discomforting: One sculpture comprises a performer pressing their forehead against a stack of three oranges; in another, a spectator is asked to plank their body atop a set of midcentury stools."

"3986","A swoon-worthy opening immediately places Bruno de Almeida’s latest film in a world that seems to exist only in cinema: A suave, wavy-haired Michael Imperioli steps out onto an empty, neon-lit street, as an Italian ballad plays in the background. “Cabaret Maxime” (also the name of the nightclub Imperioli’s character, Bennie Gaza, runs) takes place during an indefinable year, in an indefinable place. The setting looks like it could be any number of European cities, though it was shot in Lisbon with all English-speaking actors."
"3987","There is nothing objectionable about Michael Bully Herbig’s glossy political thriller, “Balloon,” but there’s nothing particularly exciting about it, either. A true-life tale of how two families narrowly escaped from communist East Germany in 1979 in a homemade hot-air balloon, the movie adopts a path so dramatically familiar we can almost predict each twist and fake-out."

"4008","Night is practically eternal in “Vitalina Varela,” the new picture from the Portuguese master Pedro Costa. In this vision, the barrios of Fontainhas, in Lisbon, where much of Costa’s work has been set and shot, seem to have mostly migrated underground. (In reality, the barrios have been so transformed over the years that they no longer exist as such.) The movie’s opening shot is exemplary: a beautifully framed (in the almost square Academy ratio) view of an alleyway, the curve of the gray wall on its left creating a visually attractive angle. At the top of the frame, black; it’s a submerged alley, and at the top right you can see some crosses planted in the ground above. Some men come through the space; it’s a funeral procession."

"4017","The documentary “Viral: Anti-Semitism in Four Mutations” begins with a voice-over, as the television star Julianna Margulies (who is Jewish), explains that anti-Semitism infects like a virus and spreads globally in a constant search for a new host. It’s a rich metaphor, particularly given that images of infestation have long been used as weapons against Jewish communities. But the film never explicitly places its central image within that history, and this lack of analysis continues to frustrate even when the film hits on resonant ideas."

How many times did I moan about someone who seemed to be so much more accomplished than I? How much of my consciousness was dedicated to cataloging how many years (or months, even) younger or older a perceived rival was than I? I wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to be an editor in chief, and yet everyone always seemed so much further ahead of me; everyone else’s pace looked so much brisker, their triumph so much more assured."

Yet there is still a certain pleasure in a story straightforwardly told, in alternating chapters, including each main character’s point of view. Amanda Eyre Ward’s “The Jetsetters” is one of those books, delivering a narrative of family dysfunction in which each member is a mess and everyone gets a say."
"4123","Jayne Matthews thinks that most hairstylists are doing it wrong: “A person takes a pair of scissors and cuts the ends, maybe gives the hair some layers, but in general it’s like a big, shaped block on the head that needs to be blown into a manageable style.” Ms. Matthews — the co-owner of two salons in the San Francisco Bay Area, both called Edo — uses a straight razor as a carving tool instead of scissors. “I can carve petals into hair so it can have length but be lighter,” she says. “I consider it the difference between a hedge and a bonsai tree.”"

The beat is tense and ornery, and Pop Smoke, with a voice as soothing as industrial machinery, was a lordly narrator of impending mayhem. Rattling car windows, the song was a reminder of how New York hip-hop once sounded, and dominated. Booming out of nightclub speakers, it was an incitement to dance-floor insurrection."

One of the Book Review’s 10 Best Books of 2019, this account of the decades-long political violence called the Troubles begins with the 1972 disappearance of Jean McConville, a widowed mother of 10 suspected by the I.R.A. of being an informer. In these pages, Roddy Doyle called Keefe “a terrific storyteller.”"
"4138","The shocking images of children lying naked on the floor in front of feces-smeared walls at a state institution seemed impossible to forget. And the reaction to Geraldo Rivera’s 1972 news broadcast from the institution, the Willowbrook State School, was quick and severe. Lawsuits were filed, leading to a landmark settlement in which New York State agreed to shut down the Staten Island institution for children and adults with developmental disabilities. It was a major civil rights victory that ultimately helped to end the warehousing of people with disabilities."
"4139","In 2019, we ran a piece about why American men don’t take paternity leave, even when it’s on offer to them. While 90 percent of fathers take some time off after their children are born, the majority of them take less than 10 days away from the job. Nathaniel Popper, an NYT Parenting contributor, said one reason is that new dads fear they might be stigmatized by their employers and miss out on future opportunities."

This spring, a new group of young designers, mostly from the British Isles, who have come of age in destabilizing times, have built their collections around declarative, visionary shapes that jettison old ideas about symmetry and balance. Consider the voluminous dresses of Richard Malone, the Irish designer committed to sustainable sourcing and limited production; his red, blue and green confections, made of jersey regenerated from fishing nets and plastic bottles, billowed out from diagonal seams, spilling across the runway in an evocation of rising seas and melting glaciers. Then there’s the work of the York, England-based Matty Bovan, whose Hope and Fear collection featured unnerving sculptural forms — like oversize collars and inverted hoop skirts that alluded to dystopian courtiers — swathed in nostalgic Liberty fabrics that didn’t so much conform to the body as they did create a protective shield sitting loosely around it."

Wurm, who lives and works between Vienna and Limberg, is best known for his extensive, ongoing “One Minute Sculpture” series, which interrogates the boundaries between visual and performance art, audience and actor, and proposes a new definition for sculpture entirely. To create the works, the 65-year-old artist provides written or illustrated instructions for viewers, inviting them to pose with wooden furniture, plastic buckets or ballpoint pens in unusual, sometimes physically strenuous, positions. The resulting contortions, which Wurm records in photographs, are at once humorous and discomforting: One sculpture comprises a performer pressing their forehead against a stack of three oranges; in another, a spectator is asked to plank their body atop a set of midcentury stools."

They are small and tautly composed, with radiant colors and chiseled forms; the word “gems” applies with an unusual, unhackneyed precision. Although celebrated in Europe, Salvo the painter has had only two gallery solos in New York, at Gladstone in 1986 and Ierimonti in 2016."

The movie, based a novel by Christine Leunens, follows Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), a 10-year-old in Nazi Germany whose imaginary best friend is Adolf Hitler (Waititi) and whose mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), is hiding a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house.

In each painting, the setting is surreal but the figure’s stance is coolly elegant; his eyes, pupil-less white orbs, suggest an inner reverie.

The speech, barely more than 700 words, is now considered one of the most important in American history. But on the day it was delivered, March 4, 1865, with the Union on the brink of victory in the Civil War, Lincoln had trouble placating his own party, much less his political opponents. And he opted to write words that addressed slavery in grand, religious terms, rather than itemizing the practical ways in which the country would have to begin moving forward. In “Every Drop of Blood,” Edward Achorn addresses sweeping issues about the war and the precarious state of the nation by narrowing his lens to the 24 hours around the inauguration and the many notable characters around the president that day.

Some she’s found on her travels for her brand — which has grown, since her iconic 1974 silk jersey wrap dress was introduced, to include 85 stores on four continents — others were given to her by friends or family. “Their power is in the energy of the person who gives them to you, or the place where they came from,” says von Furstenberg, who was born and raised in Belgium. The designer’s company bears the surname of her first husband, the German prince Egon von Furstenberg, with whom she had two children: a son, Alexander, and daughter, Tatiana. Her granddaughter Talita now designs TVF, the brand’s more youthful line, which launched last April.

Then, at last, these creative impulses converge on the runway, becoming huge and audacious and affecting — as with Jacobs’s fall 2020 women’s wear show, a “nostalgic ode to the city itself” that closed New York Fashion Week last Wednesday night. “There’s something within the process,” he tells Taseer, describing his shows, “where the energy continues to grow and is somehow amplified and transferred within those seven minutes.”"

The director Dee Rees’s 2017 adaptation of the  novel “Mudbound,” about a black family and a white family in rural Mississippi in the 1940s, picked up four Oscar nominations, and Rees was the first black woman to be nominated for the best adapted screenplay Oscar. Like “Mudbound,” Rees’s latest film, “The Last Thing He Wanted,” is also adapted from a novel — but that’s about where the similarities end. Based on Joan Didion’s 1996 book of the same name, “The Last Thing He Wanted” is a geopolitical thriller about a Reagan-era journalist (Elena McMahon, played by Anne Hathaway) who goes to Central America to investigate illicit weapons sales. Its cast also includes Ben Affleck (as an American diplomat) and Willem Dafoe (Elena’s shady father)."

"4768","WHITMER THOMAS: THE GOLDEN ONE (2020) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The Los Angeles-based comedian, actor and musician Whitmer Thomas keeps audiences guessing with his unusual, deeply personal sets. Is it appropriate to laugh when he performs his goth-pop song “Partied to Death?” (“My mommy drank herself to death/and I know she tried her very best/But now I can’t party because my mommy partied to death.”) Such painful realizations are sprinkled throughout this new comedy special, filmed at the same Florida bar where Thomas’s mother used to perform with her band. Much of the special is on the lighter side, though. Thomas riffs on his childhood in Alabama and his time in an emo rock band, and performs songs from his upcoming debut record, “Songs From the Golden One.”"
"4769","Since founding Proenza Schouler in 2002, the designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez have largely avoided collaborations with other companies. “They became such a thing everyone did,” says Hernandez, “and we kind of like to do the opposite.” That meant focusing on refining their own aesthetic language and producing elegant clothes that look the way a good idea feels: pleasurably counterintuitive, accessible yet complex, at once inevitable and original. Often the pair achieves this sort of tension by balancing the conceptual with the casual. It’s no surprise, then, that when they did decide to collaborate, it was with Birkenstock, the nearly 250-year-old German shoe company whose legions of fans include many a fashion person, perhaps because the iconic chunky sandals can always be relied upon to offset a look that threatens to come off as too dressed."

Other preparations include a Hawaiian wedge salad, Japanese pancakes made in a waffle iron, spare ribs and a vegan falafel bao bun with mayonnaise. For drinks, the emphasis is on sake and sake cocktails. The brick-walled space has simple bare-wood furnishings. And like Ippudo, it will not accept reservations. (Opens Thursday)"

It’s also drought-resistant, nutritious, gluten-free and better for the soil than the commodity crops like corn, wheat, soy and rice that have become Africa’s agricultural staples. Once fonio is winnowed and dried, the tiny grains (much smaller than quinoa) can be steamed and used in various ways. (Care must be taken so it doesn’t clump and get gummy, and reheating can be tricky.) The book concentrates on traditional African dishes, with ingredients like cassava, okra, baobab leaf and red palm oil. But for wider appeal, like that of quinoa, it needs more recipes like his excellent roasted salmon with cheesy fonio grits. For me, fonio is more like polenta or cream of wheat than quinoa.

"5260","Earlier this year, the designer Virgil Abloh — a hallowed name in streetwear who was appointed artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s line in 2018 — tried something new (for him): suiting. Down the fashion house’s fall 2020 men’s runway came elegant overcoats and shorter jackets pieced together from puzzle-like segments; the models wove through oversize props, like a pair of scissors, a pencil and a spool of thread, as if Abloh hoped to animate the very craft that brought those garments out of his atelier. Throughout the fashion world, men’s tailoring is anything but stuffy or staid these days, despite its sometimes conservative reputation. In checks and tartans, it can be punk; with soft, boxy silhouettes, it can be easy; and — paired with transparent blouses, ruffle details and velvet trim — it can subvert gender lines. Or, as the stylist Jacob K and the photographer Kristin-Lee Moolman propose here, when paired with motocross gloves, jerseys and socks (and perhaps even an actual motorbike), it can be sporty and rebellious."

But he undermined his own effectiveness after it became apparent that before displaying a map in front of the television cameras in the Oval Office, he had altered it with a Sharpie pen to match his inaccurate forecast of where the storm was headed."
"5264","BOSTON — They have been expelled from schools, haunted by nightmares and panic attacks, whispered about by classmates, and mocked online. For the young people whose parents were charged in the nation’s largest college admissions cheating scandal, society’s punishment came swiftly, often before their parents had their cases heard in court."

"5276","Trust me, even if you’ve been looking at art for a long, long time (or even longer than that), you will see work at the Art Show at the Park Avenue Armory you have not seen before, by artists you may never have heard of. This is not because the Art Show, organized by the Art Dealers Association of America to benefit Henry Street Settlement, is dedicated to showing the young and hip. Quite the opposite, ADAA represents blue-chip galleries that show high-quality work."
"5277","Unlike most spy thrillers in which statuesque, expensively dressed women show an unexpected talent for kicking the bejeezus out of armed men, the South African series “Queen Sono” also devotes a lot of time to historical and geopolitical debate, or at least sloganeering. An armed band that might be terrorists or might be freedom fighters declares its intent to liberate Africa from “the clutches of colonization.” A hapless do-gooder calls out the primary villain for being a neocolonialist, and is quickly abducted with extreme prejudice."

His brother moved in to take care of him, but he, too, began to lose weight, look rough and was seen drunk on the block."

"5284","In “The Invisible Man,” an update of the 1933 Universal classic, the director Leigh Whannell elicits pulse-quickening scares from shots of a random jogger, an empty room (or is it?), a guy slapping a car window, and a dog bowl. None of these elements were particularly costly to shoot, nor was the movie itself, which was filmed in Australia in 40 days at the relatively modest cost of $8 million. “It’s a low-budget film by Hollywood standards, and certainly by Universal standards,” Whannell said."

If you come down with (or are exposed to) certain communicable diseases, including cholera, diphtheria, infectious tuberculosis, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic fever, SARS or a pandemic influenza, the state and federal governments can force you into quarantine and isolation.

The new big-screen adaptation of Jack London’s “The Call of the Wild” shares an actor with “War for the Planet of the Apes,” but you won’t see his face in either movie: He’s Terry Notary, a motion-capture performer whose movements provided the basis for the digital dog that stars opposite Harrison Ford in “The Call of the Wild,” and who played one of Andy Serkis’s chimpanzee companions in the “Planet of the Apes” movies of the 2010s. “War for the Planet of the Apes,” the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) “The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times."

In it, superpowered teenagers train to become professional heroes, then find themselves tested by the emergence of real villains.

That may sound like a surprisingly unglamorous concern for a luxury clothing brand, but Hearst’s namesake label, which she founded in New York City in 2015, is remarkable not only for its attention to high-level craft and luxurious materials — including merino wool sheared from sheep reared on the 17,000-acre ranch she inherited in 2011 from her father in her native Uruguay — but also for her minute focus on how her clothes, whether a figure-skimming, graphic-printed knit dress or an ankle-length trench, make women feel.

A ramen master and native of Hakata, Japan, Mr. Kanegae has extensive international credentials, working elsewhere in Asia, as well as Paris, Los Angeles and New York, where he arrived in 2007 and helped to open and run the Ippudo restaurants in the United States. He has also made stops in London, Texas and Mexico, among others. His experiences have led him to tinker with tradition, coming up with a collection of fusion dishes, some of which he will be serving here. A signature ramen dish, ti amo, uses a base of chicken and oyster broths, with the addition of chicken, mashed potatoes, bacon and lemon. Other preparations include a Hawaiian wedge salad, Japanese pancakes made in a waffle iron, spare ribs and a vegan falafel bao bun with mayonnaise. For drinks, the emphasis is on sake and sake cocktails. The brick-walled space has simple bare-wood furnishings. And like Ippudo, it will not accept reservations. (Opens Thursday)"

"5543","In 1973, Elizabeth Hardwick declared that sex could no longer be the subject of great literature. The novel of seduction — in the vein of “The Scarlet Letter” and “Tess of the D’Urbervilles,” of Dreiser, Zola and Henry James — was dead. “You cannot seduce anyone when innocence is not a value,” she wrote in a precise, imperiously beautiful essay, “Seduction and Betrayal.” Some 25 years later, Vivian Gornick asserted that the novel of love was now in uncertain health. We simply know too much to believe such stories with the old fervor, she argued in “The End of the Novel of Love.” The notion of romance as a vehicle for self-discovery asks us to disregard what we know to be true: This is work we must do for ourselves."

Set in the everyday drabness of Bucharest or other, even less glamorous Romanian cities, they turn the grievances, frustrations and hopes of ordinary people into deadpan philosophical case studies. “12:08 East of Bucharest” is an inquiry into the subjective nature of historical experience. “Police, Adjective” is a seminar on law, ethics and the meaning of words. “The Treasure” is both a fable of futility worthy of Samuel Beckett and an allegory of Romania’s precarious place at the margins of the European Union."

"5926","The adventure capital of New Zealand, Queenstown, the South Island’s magnetic mountain resort, thrives on adrenaline. Site of the first commercial bungee-jumping operation — established in 1988 over the Kawarau River — Queenstown is the place to test your courage by jumping off, flying over or skimming above things. During the winter (June through September), visitors flock to four ski areas in the surrounding Southern Alps. The rest of the year, Queenstown serves as the gateway to Mount Aspiring National Park, Fiordland National Park in the west, and countless hikes, including multiday treks on the Milford, Routeburn Greenstone and Caples tracks. In March, the beginning of fall, the crowds have eased but the weather is still great for outdoor adventures. The Akarua Arrowtown Autumn Festival in nearby Arrowtown is from April 16 to 20, and the LUMA Southern Light Project, which brings light installations to Queenstown Gardens, takes place May 29 to June 1. On the shores of glacially carved Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand’s third largest lake, Queenstown offers a respite from the wild with sophisticated dining and shopping, each with a distinct Kiwi accent."

"6198","THE KINGMAKER (2019) 9 p.m. Showtime. Gold and diamonds commingle with political unrest and poverty in “The Kingmaker,” Lauren Greenfield’s documentary portrait of Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines. Through interviews — including with Marcos, who speaks here at length — and other footage, Greenfield (“The Queen of Versailles”) examines Marcos’s time as first lady during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s; her subsequent flight and exile; and her place in contemporary politics. The film ultimately “becomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “Greenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes — those notorious emblems of Marcos’s excess — but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury,” Dargis wrote. “It’s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history.”"

"6205","GHENT, Belgium — God is in the details, they assure you; but some art is so jam-packed with details, each hair so fine, each fold so painstaking, that it surpasses even the divine. Nearly six centuries ago, here in the northwest corner of Europe, the painter Jan van Eyck used a brand-new technology — oil paint — to pioneer an art of such precision that it almost negated its religious function, and went past inspiring prayer to become something eternal itself. Still today, for secular audiences, his diamond-hard paintings can appear to come from another world."

Donald Judd, pioneer of the 1960s movement called Minimalism (the label wasn’t his; he hated it), thought about this constantly. He wanted, right from the start, to be a big art deal, a super influencer. Long before his death in 1994, at 65, he was."

Many Italian editors and buyers had decided to forgo Paris altogether. Nonetheless, the buzz around the Portuguese designer Felipe Oliveira Baptista’s debut at Kenzo persisted — and offered a welcomed distraction. Oliveira Baptista, 45, who hit his stride during his previous post, an eight-year tenure as the creative director at Lacoste, took over as the creative director of the 50-year-old house from Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, the U.S. retailers behind Opening Ceremony, who had shared the position since 2011. If Lim and Leon reinvigorated the brand with streetwear-inflected pieces and a youthful pop sensibility, Oliveira Baptista promised something more finessed."

The idea came to Jason Segel, the show’s creator and star, after he discovered an art project and immersive game that drew more than 7,000 people in San Francisco and Oakland from 2008 to 2011. He adapted it for the screen and plays one of four characters (along with Sally Field, André Benjamin and Eve Lindley) who are brought together by what is, at the outset, to some a practical joke and to others a global conspiracy. There’s an element of growth here: Along the way, the journey helps participants overcome inner battles. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Segel said the show celebrates regular people. “A lot of stories are about someone finding out that they’re extraordinary,” he said. “And this whole thing, it’s this idea that we can all be ordinary together and that it’s beautiful.”"
