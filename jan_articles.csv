"17","BREAKTHROUGH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. A tragedy happens on ice — and an apparent miracle happens off it — in this faith-based drama from the TV veteran Roxann Dawson. The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital — but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the community’s subsequent push to aid in John’s recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film “tells the story of John’s miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization,” Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, “the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it.”"

Instead of sending a single endangered innocent on a desperate race to escape some nefarious villain, he lets a group of villains loose on a defenseless town and sends a lone avenger to chase them down. Ever the master of detail, Perry first takes us to the Weldonville Federal Penitentiary in rural Colorado to marvel at the ingenuity of a dozen prisoners who escape by killing a dozen guards. But that’s not the worst of it. After dressing in the guards’ street clothes, the escapees allow more than 1,000 other prisoners to descend on the town “like an invading army” to kill and rape and burn the place to the ground. In effect, “they murdered Weldonville.” Two years later, Lt. Leah Hawkins is put on leave from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and unofficially licensed to hunt and kill the 12 ringleaders, now scattered across the country."

"44","Walking the vibrant streets of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic’s capital, can be frustrating for the beach-seeking tourist — you’re tantalized by the sight of the sea but the best beaches, with that quintessential stretch of pristine sand, are miles away. But history, culture and nature abound in this cosmopolitan Caribbean city, where Christopher Columbus landed in 1492. The oldest church and first paved road in the Americas are both in Santo Domingo’s Zona Colonial, but so are plenty of new businesses that reflect an evolving artistic and activist presence. These days you can find: Mamey, an L.G.B.T.Q.-friendly cultural space featuring a bookstore, gallery and theater; Microteatro, which delivers 15-minute plays about Dominican life; and Miss Rizos Salón, a hair parlor that often hosts events to fight the stigma against kinky or curly hair. There are also pockets of nature amid the bustle. In Santo Domingo Este, a short drive from the city center, is an underground lake where Taíno women once bathed. And in Santo Domingo and elsewhere, an influx of immigrants, including Haitian, Chinese and Venezuelan, have left their mark in recent decades — most noticeable, perhaps, on the culinary scene, bringing everything from arepas to dumplings. Santo Domingo is a city alive and in transition, the sea a mere backdrop to its many charms."

So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music.” That’s not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn’t have the typical rock star’s career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (“People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself,” she says in the documentary, “but I never invented myself to start with.”) Her varied career is the focus here; it’s discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. “The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.

It is a tour de force of one man’s vision of the best Japan has to offer; nearly every detail, from the cocktails to the glasses in which they’re served, has been designed by Ogata himself. It’s also his first solo foray into France, though his considered approach — to seek beauty and balance in all things — is the same one that’s governed all of his pursuits, including a bistro set in a plum tree-filled garden in Tokyo’s residential Meguro Ward and a collection of tree-free bamboo and bagasse paper plates made to look as thin and refined as china.

Instead of sending a single endangered innocent on a desperate race to escape some nefarious villain, he lets a group of villains loose on a defenseless town and sends a lone avenger to chase them down. Ever the master of detail, Perry first takes us to the Weldonville Federal Penitentiary in rural Colorado to marvel at the ingenuity of a dozen prisoners who escape by killing a dozen guards. But that’s not the worst of it. After dressing in the guards’ street clothes, the escapees allow more than 1,000 other prisoners to descend on the town “like an invading army” to kill and rape and burn the place to the ground. In effect, “they murdered Weldonville.” Two years later, Lt.

Ari Aster made waves in 2018 with the release of his debut feature, “Hereditary.” A year later, he delivered another haunting watch, “Midsommar.” The protagonists, Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), are on the verge of breaking up until a family tragedy brings them closer. Not close enough, that is, as Christian is emotionally detached while a grieving Dani clings onto him for comfort. Months later, Christian reluctantly invites Dani to join him and his friends at a festival in a remote Swedish village that occurs every 90 years.

"419","Thomas Perry pulls the old switcheroo in A SMALL TOWN (Mysterious Press, $26). Instead of sending a single endangered innocent on a desperate race to escape some nefarious villain, he lets a group of villains loose on a defenseless town and sends a lone avenger to chase them down. Ever the master of detail, Perry first takes us to the Weldonville Federal Penitentiary in rural Colorado to marvel at the ingenuity of a dozen prisoners who escape by killing a dozen guards. But that’s not the worst of it. After dressing in the guards’ street clothes, the escapees allow more than 1,000 other prisoners to descend on the town “like an invading army” to kill and rape and burn the place to the ground. In effect, “they murdered Weldonville.” Two years later, Lt. Leah Hawkins is put on leave from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and unofficially licensed to hunt and kill the 12 ringleaders, now scattered across the country."

Among the other contenders are “1917,” “The Irishman” and “The Joker,” for best drama, and “Dolemite Is My Name,” “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “Rocketman” for best musical or comedy. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that produces the Globes, faced a backlash for excluding women in several major categories, including best director and motion picture. The best drama series category includes nominations for “The Morning Show,” “Big Little Lies” and “Killing Eve,” while “Fleabag,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Barry” will compete for best comedy series. Ricky Gervais returns to host for the fifth time, which he says will be his last. Expect plenty of jabs. "

To participate in the program, which offers 29 mountains for adoption, Eli’s Manhattan has agreed to buy several wheels of L’Etivaz Tompey every year. Each weighs about 60 pounds."

San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month. Hugo named the series after the popular folk song about an injured cockroach whose lyrics are often rewritten in Mexico as political satire."

I visited at the end of May, only a couple of days before the opening date of the tour, and among Dio’s team, there was a tangible air of anticipation. Dio never became a household name, but he is considered one of the great heavy-metal vocalists of all time, up there with Ozzy Osbourne (whom he replaced in Black Sabbath) and metal-adjacent rockers like Axl Rose and Robert Plant.

San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month. Hugo named the series after the popular folk song about an injured cockroach whose lyrics are often rewritten in Mexico as political satire."

"1210","PARTY OF FIVE 9 p.m. on Freeform. Almost 20 years after its original run ended, the sitcom “Party of Five” is returning to television — with a jolt of modern political weight. The series, which debuted in 1994 and ran for six seasons, centered on a group of siblings who supported themselves after their parents died in a car crash. (It didn’t always go smoothly.) The new version, helmed by the series’s original creators, departs from the original story line in a major way: This time, the family members are on their own because their parents are deported to Mexico, not killed. And one sibling is a Dreamer. “This is an opportunity to really get into the perspective of a group of people in this country that has been marginalized — and on many occasions villainized — and just show they are people, too,” Michal Zebede, a co-executive producer and writer on the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times."

"1226","WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi quietly laid the groundwork on Thursday to send impeachment articles against President Trump to the Senate, indicating that the House would “soon” end a weekslong impasse and vote to bring the charges to trial."
"1227","For now we seem to have averted an all-out shooting war between the United States and Iran."
"1228","Since Donald Trump’s election in 2016, the left has obsessed over which voters to mobilize and how to do so. One camp wants to concentrate on moderate white voters. Another says white suburban women are the key to victory in 2020. Yet what may be the most effective use of resources is to reach out to a group of voters few strategists are talking about: infrequent voters, who are disproportionately women, people of color and young people. "
"1229","CANBERRA, Australia — Every state in Australia has been touched by fire since the season started in September. The fires have burned over 12 million acres, an area larger than Maryland. Four hundred and eighty million animals are estimated to be killed or badly injured. Thousands of people have been evacuated. At least 24 have died. "
"1230","Unexpectedly, the 2020 presidential campaign is drilling down on petty crime and homelessness. Donald Trump and his Republican allies are reviving law-and-order themes similar to those used effectively by Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew in the late 1960s and early 1970s to demonize racial minorities."
"1231","DOHA, Qatar — The future of the art world may be in a vast desert landscape where audacious museums are melding both local culture and the outside world in a way that feels fresh and revolutionary. "
"1232","HAMBURG, Germany — Are the Germans irrational? Steven Pinker seems to think so. Professor Pinker, a Harvard psychologist, told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel recently that if mankind wanted to stop climate change without stopping economic growth too, the world needed more nuclear energy, not less. Germany’s decision to step out of nuclear, he agreed, was “paranoid.”"
"1233","On Tuesday night Julián Castro appeared at a rally in Brooklyn alongside Elizabeth Warren to express support for her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. It’s no surprise that in a field of candidates that’s grown increasingly male and white, he opted to throw his support behind the leading female candidate. "
"1234","WASHINGTON — A sharply divided House voted on Thursday to force President Trump to come to Congress for authorization before taking further military action against Iran, in a sharp response to his ratcheting up of hostilities with Tehran without the explicit approval of the legislative branch."
"1235","PLYMOUTH, N.H. — Tim Smith is 35, relatively young compared with other voters. He calls himself an independent, which is common here in New Hampshire. And he’s uneasy about the political establishment and Democratic Party standard-bearers."

"1237","In 1981, Mary Steenburgen won the best supporting actress Oscar for “Melvin and Howard.” On Monday, she will find out if she’s earned her second-ever Academy Award nomination, in a very different category: best original song. “Glasgow (No Place Like Home),” which she wrote with Caitlyn Smith and Kate York for the music drama “Wild Rose,” made the shortlist of potential nominees."
"1238","Sometimes I, a full-grown adult, see a so-called lift-the-flap book, meant for babies and toddlers, and become almost tingly with the desire to feel those cardboard tabs under my fingers and discover what’s hidden behind each one. It makes me suspect that interactive board books hit some primal sweet spot — and literacy research, it turns out, backs up my instinct. Our brains evolved to seek out and benefit from “multisensory” experiences, especially when our cognitive abilities are still developing. Young children exposed to books that engage more than one sense tend to have better comprehension and enthusiasm for reading down the road."
"1239","This property is in Lincoln Park, a neighborhood of Victorians and Craftsman-style homes that was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It is about a mile southwest of downtown and the same distance northwest of Minnesota State University, Mankato. (Gustavus Adolphus College in the city of St. Peter is 13 miles north; Minneapolis is 80 miles northeast.) The childhood home of Maud Hart Lovelace, the author of the Betsy-Tacy children’s book series introduced in the 1940s, is three blocks away."

"1242","Susan Barba’s second book, “geode,” is rich with shining interiors and tactile relationships, delicate human to delicate earth, small delusions of ownership against wider backdrops of loss and time. Poems acting as guides, helping us navigate and remember, create an intricate overlay of worlds, humans and trees. This poem — bearing words like “testify” and “judge” — echoes our current moment and offers relief. The title itself is a strong suggestion: We have to keep working at not letting the anger overtake us, hold on too long. Selected by Naomi Shihab Nye"

"1248","Bob Wade, a Texas artist whose 40-foot-long iguana sculpture once perched atop the Lone Star Cafe in Manhattan and whose 63-foot-high saxophone lured patrons to a blues nightclub in Houston, died on Dec. 24 at his home in Austin. He was 76. "

"1280","PARTY OF FIVE 9 p.m. on Freeform. Almost 20 years after its original run ended, the sitcom “Party of Five” is returning to television — with a jolt of modern political weight. The series, which debuted in 1994 and ran for six seasons, centered on a group of siblings who supported themselves after their parents died in a car crash. (It didn’t always go smoothly.) The new version, helmed by the series’s original creators, departs from the original story line in a major way: This time, the family members are on their own because their parents are deported to Mexico, not killed. And one sibling is a Dreamer. “This is an opportunity to really get into the perspective of a group of people in this country that has been marginalized — and on many occasions villainized — and just show they are people, too,” Michal Zebede, a co-executive producer and writer on the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times."

It’s the work of Company You Keep Hospitality, a division of Company, the firm that owns the building. The restaurant’s food consists mostly of bar fare, like charcuterie plates, pizza bianca with various toppings, and dips like a take on cacio e pepe with flatbread. Tien Ho, who was formerly with Momofuku, Whole Foods and, briefly, Wild Ink in Hudson Yards, is the chef.

The season builds toward a big competition — but, as with “Last Chance U,” its heart is set less on the question of whether the team will win or lose and more on the players, whose personal lives and emotions rush to the surface as they chase athletic perfection. “The way that we prepare, you keep going until you get it right,” the team’s coach, Monica Aldama, says in the first episode. “And then you keep going until you can’t get it wrong.”"

I wrapped the scarf around my pet, Frances, a black cat with green eyes identical to Lizzie’s cat Arabella, took a picture and texted it to her. “Remember this scarf?” I wrote. "
"1370","Can any past presidential campaign help us understand the election year now beginning? There never was a sitting president like Donald Trump. But if we widen our lens, we find timely echoes in an era when America was rapidly changing, the old political order was coming apart, and it seemed like the country was about to split at the seams."

"1373","SAN DIEGO — When the nation’s economists gathered here over the weekend, the event looked different than in past years. There was a woman holding “office hours” to help victims of sexual harassment and abuse. Job interviews were no longer conducted in hotel rooms, where female candidates had long felt uncomfortable. There was a long list of panel discussions on racism and sexism in the profession."

This happened once when she was 9 or 10, and working in the garden with her mother in Oxford. Pugh had a respiratory illness that kept her out of school for long stretches of time. At home, when she wasn’t studying or attempting cartwheels in the yard, she would help her mother with chores around the house, or in the garden, turning up weeds and tamping down bulbs."

"1388","The day after I watched the documentary “Earth,” I spent time working in my garden, digging, planting, getting my hands dirty. I didn’t grow up gardening and I’m not especially good at it. Even so, when I’m not inadvertently killing plants, I find it satisfying tending the yard. It’s a small pleasure, though given what the domination of nature has wrought, also a paradoxical one. More than 12 million acres have burned in Australia as of this week and, as this movie reminds you, there is no escaping complicity in what the environmentalist Bill McKibben has called “the end of nature.”"
"1389","The signs were as loud as klaxon horns, warning us that “Like a Boss” would be a stinker: the January release date, the shoddy poster, the dubious conceit (the beauty business is, uh, ugly).

"1393","Early on in this mercifully short horror picture, a crew member — one of a handful trapped nearly seven miles beneath the ocean in a collapsing futuristic oil rig — wrests from the sea an aggressive, super-gnarly-looking creature, which he brings to show the gang. “Oh no,” a viewer might think, “you never bring the gnarly-looking thing back on the ship. Has no one in this movie seen ‘Alien?’” Maybe, maybe not, but it doesn’t matter, as the thing doesn’t get to do much in that moment."

His findings, about which even he eventually raised ethical qualms, weren’t limited to professional journals. The movie “Three Christs” is based on his book “The Three Christs of Ypsilanti,” published in 1964 and still in print. The story has been dramatized elsewhere, including onstage."

For one recent apartment redesign in Monte Carlo, the unique Mediterranean light and the Modernist building itself inspired Parente to work with textured materials that would be enhanced by the changing shadows; by contrast, in 2015 he transformed a Parisian apartment built in 1910 into a spare futuristic pod with concrete walls and glossy red floors, channeling the client’s devotion to Buddhism, modern architecture and David Lynch."

These frequent changes between schools of strikingly varying quality trouble military children both socially and academically.

"1540","How should one live? It’s a brief, potent and timeless question, explored in a few of this week’s recommended books. In her debut memoir, “Uncanny Valley,” Anna Wiener recounts leaving her low-paying publishing job for Silicon Valley, and the ensuing optimism and disenchantment she experienced. In the darkly comic novel “The Heap,” Sean Adams explores what happens to survivors after a skyscraping utopia collapses. Another collapse — this time of a steeple — occurs in Sylvia Townsend Warner’s “The Corner That Held Them,” a novel that immerses readers in the daily life of a 14th-century English convent."

"1542","I recently resolved to kick one of my least-favorite habits: crying during movie trailers. I can weep without shame watching movies themselves. But trailer tears are different — not the effect of an emotionally destabilizing encounter with art but, rather, the tacky end result of bluntly Pavlovian marketing machinery, the component parts of which remain clear to me even as my gaze grows watery. Professionally expressive faces projected across field-of-vision-encompassing screens, uttering heart-rending phonemes rid of all meaningful context, accompanied by huge swells of music? I am this easily played, I tell myself, somehow rolling my eyes while simultaneously dabbing at them with the back of my hand, in case anyone nearby might think I’m that moved by the prospect of seeing, I don’t know, “Dolittle.” The problem, at bottom, is one of category confusion. With a tear-jerker trailer, we’re tricked into mistaking a piece of advertising for a piece of art — a distinction it’s possible to complicate but never, if the word “art” is to mean anything, undo."

"1566","Take the most combustible, scarred, dysfunctional relationship the United States has with any country in the world and place it in the hands of an impulsive, ignorant, bullying American leader and you are likely to sleepwalk to the brink of war.

"1574","It’s not hard to see what drew two of the finest actors of their generation to play James R. Hoffa. Sure, the man spent decades in the public eye, led what was then the nation’s largest labor union, sparred with the Kennedys and disappeared in one of the quintessential unsolved mysteries in recent history. But he’s also a great character, a sizzle reel of big, boisterous speeches, roaring dressing-downs and showy theatricality. It’s the kind of role an actor can really sink his teeth into, especially if he’s known for chewing a bit of scenery — a delicacy frequently enjoyed by both Jack Nicholson, who played the title role in the 1992 “Hoffa,” and Al Pacino, currently garnering awards buzz for his work as Hoffa in “The Irishman.”"

"1585","In 2018, the curator Francisco Berzunza invited the South African artist Pieter Hugo to Mexico to create a body of work that would engage with themes of sexuality and death for an exhibition at the Centro Fotográfico Manuel Álvarez Bravo. During his monthlong stay, Hugo searched for a response to this prompt, and inspiration came when he chanced upon a platter of desiccated fruits in Oaxaca. “Making Pigments. San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month. Hugo named the series after the popular folk song about an injured cockroach whose lyrics are often rewritten in Mexico as political satire."
"1586","When our first child graduated from college, his godfathers (a gay couple) gave him a substantial monetary gift. When our second child graduated, the godfathers were going through a messy breakup and failed to acknowledge his graduation in any way. We’ve never mentioned this to the godfathers. Our second child is now about to earn his master’s degree. He recently told us he feels sad that his godfathers remembered his brother’s graduation, but not his. Should we remind the godfathers to acknowledge our younger son’s upcoming graduation and what they gave our older child? Trust me, it’s not about the money. We are still close with both men."

San Agustin Etla” (2018), which shows a spread of dying crops in bold hues, was the first image Hugo captured in Mexico. But “something shifted” during that first visit, Hugo says. “I don’t know why, but I’m not done here,” he remembers thinking; he has since visited Mexico four more times, traveling between the bustling border city of Tijuana in the north, the colonial town of San Cristóbal de las Casas in the Central Highlands and the indigenous Zapotec town of Juchitán in the southern state of Oaxaca. “From the Day of the Dead to narco-politics, death is strongly felt there,” he says of the country, but it was its people’s day-to-day understanding of life’s fragility that inspired his new photography series, “La Cucaracha,” which will go on display at Yossi Milo Gallery in New York this month. Hugo named the series after the popular folk song about an injured cockroach whose lyrics are often rewritten in Mexico as political satire."

It is the third installment in the “John Wick” franchise by the returning director Chad Stahelski, and it picks up where the second film left off. John (Keanu Reeves) has been excommunicated from the High Table, the global society of villains to which he once belonged, and has a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head. Suddenly there’s a killer on every corner. Knowing he’s outnumbered, John heads to Morocco in hopes of revoking his death sentence. Along the way he seeks help from his former mentor (Anjelica Huston) and a friend from his past (Halle Berry), who has a couple of merciless dogs trained for combat. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that the movie’s endless cycle of violence can become deadening, but its elaborate thrills give it its edge. "

Human bones are strewn about New York in “The Bone Collector,” Jeffery Deaver’s 1997 novel about Lincoln Rhyme, a forensics expert who solves cases without leaving his apartment. He works with a younger detective who does the ground work in tracing a serial killer.

The one factor that may convince Ralph to see beyond cold hard facts is that he just lost his son and is looking for answers of his own."

Moments later, Backshall and his team begin a rock climbing descent down a large canyon, one he describes as “four times the height of London’s Big Ben.” Few viewers, thankfully, are likely to tune to this British show to see perfectly rational behavior: “Expedition” follows Backshall, an adventurer known for hosting the BBC Show “Deadly 60,” as he ventures across various rugged frontiers, from flooded caves in Mexico to white water rapids in Bhutan. This first episode finds him in Oman. And that descent he compares to Big Ben? It’s just the prelude to an even more intense climb."

It could take five minutes if my children simply put on what we laid out the night before. Or, 35 minutes if my 3-year-old insists on wearing the dress she wore yesterday; she has no concept of time and “yesterday”  could mean any moment in her living memory. Does she mean last week or last year? Does she still have this dress? Did it ever exist? Time is a flat circle."

"3089","For frequent travelers, it’s a constant consideration: Is it worth unpacking your suitcase while on the road, only to pack it up again? Or maybe it’s not a question that’s considered, but a deeply ingrained habit akin to always checking a bag, or preferring the window over the aisle seat or setting aside certain outfits for certain travel days."

On the Jordan River, railway ties run across a graceful bridge of black basalt that connects nothing. Under slopes of olives and pines at the banks of the Yarmouk, a tributary of the Jordan, there’s a station house used as a storeroom by fish farmers and eight abandoned rail tunnels leading to Syria."

The nominations for the 92nd annual Academy Awards were announced on Monday, recognizing many of the best films and performances of the year, some of which are already available to stream. Among them is Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory,” which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodóvar in career and appearance. “These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critic’s Pick. “The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms.”"

"3313","Garth Greenwell’s first novel, “What Belongs to You” (2016), uses mesmeric cadences. The world observed and the interior life are slowed down, the rhythms in the prose given a strange and powerful nervous energy, every nuance and angle offered their due. Narrated by a poet in a foreign country, the novel and its inflections suggest that feeling itself is almost foreign and hard to pin down; that it has to be outlined with many subclauses, digressions and asides. Language becomes a way of holding experience close before it dissolves in your hand. Some of the scenes in the book, such as when the narrator watches a boy on a train, have the aura of beautifully rich film, something captured with meticulous attention to every shift of light and atmosphere. These scenes are created with a great moody melancholy, the narrator fully aware how soon they will be over and how they must be secured before they crumble."

"3460","An Italian portrait gallery — a pinacoteca, filled with antique paintings from the family collection — would be a fitting backdrop for an Etro show any season. After all, the brand is the consummate family business, founded in 1968 by Gimmo Etro and now helmed by his four children: Kean, who designs men’s wear; Jacopo, who designs home goods and accessories; Ippolito, who handles brand strategy; and Veronica, who designs women’s wear. (Even Kean’s 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns — especially paisley. But for Etro’s fall 2020 men’s wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery. And, looming over the runway, was a pinacoteca: a collage of 19th-century portraits, some of them depicting the Etros of centuries past."

"3463","THE EAST WIND COMMUNITY is hidden deep in the Ozarks of southern Missouri, less than 10 miles from the Arkansas border, surrounded by jagged hills and tawny fields. Getting there requires traversing country roads that rise, dip and twist through chicken-wire-fenced farmsteads and grazing pastures cluttered with rusty agricultural equipment until you reach 1,145 acres of largely undeveloped highland forest, where cedar, oak, pine and mulberry create a dense canopy. Beneath that are 27 buildings and structures, including four large dormitories, nine personal shelters, a kitchen and dining facility, an automobile shop, a nut butter manufacturing plant and a cold-storage warehouse, all built over the years by the community since its founding in 1974. Outside, farm animals — six piglets, 50 chickens, several dozen brown-and-white cows — crunch through the carpet of winter leaves."

He had just clicked on a tweet from former President Obama, announcing his list of favorite books from 2019. Listed at No. 6 (titles were in alphabetical order) was Odell’s first book, “How to Do Nothing,” which our reviewer described as “a complex, smart and ambitious book that first reads like a self-help manual, then blossoms into a wide-ranging political manifesto.” The gist: Stop toggling.

"3572","We had agreed to meet at the fountain in front of the McDonald’s in Slaveykov Square. By my American standards G. was late, and as I waited for him I browsed the book stalls the square is famous for, their wares piled high under awnings in front of the city library. Really it wasn’t a fountain anymore, it had been shuttered for years, since faulty wiring stopped a man’s heart one summer as he dipped his fingers into the cool water there. It was December now, though winter hadn’t yet really taken hold; the sun was out and the weather was mild, it wasn’t unpleasant to stand for a bit and browse the books on display. From the beginning of the year G. had caught my attention, at first simply because he was beautiful, and then for the special quality of friendship I thought I saw between him and another boy in my class, the intensity with which G. sought him out and the privacy he drew about them. It was familiar to me, that intensity, a story from my own adolescence, as was the basking ambivalence with which the other boy received it, how he both invited it and held it off. I had some idea, then, what we would talk about, and why school didn’t offer enough secrecy for us to talk about it there, but I was still curious: he wasn’t a student I was particularly close to, he didn’t stop by my room outside of class, he had never confided in me or sought me out, and I wondered what crisis was bringing him to me now."

Among them is Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory,” which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodóvar in career and appearance. “These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critic’s Pick. “The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms.”"

The nominations for the 92nd annual Academy Awards were announced on Monday, recognizing many of the best films and performances of the year, some of which are already available to stream. Among them is Pedro Almodóvar’s “Pain and Glory,” which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last year’s Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodóvar in career and appearance. “These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critic’s Pick. “The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms.”"

"3732","Garth Greenwell’s first novel, “What Belongs to You” (2016), uses mesmeric cadences. The world observed and the interior life are slowed down, the rhythms in the prose given a strange and powerful nervous energy, every nuance and angle offered their due. Narrated by a poet in a foreign country, the novel and its inflections suggest that feeling itself is almost foreign and hard to pin down; that it has to be outlined with many subclauses, digressions and asides. Language becomes a way of holding experience close before it dissolves in your hand. Some of the scenes in the book, such as when the narrator watches a boy on a train, have the aura of beautifully rich film, something captured with meticulous attention to every shift of light and atmosphere. These scenes are created with a great moody melancholy, the narrator fully aware how soon they will be over and how they must be secured before they crumble."

"3839","An Italian portrait gallery — a pinacoteca, filled with antique paintings from the family collection — would be a fitting backdrop for an Etro show any season. After all, the brand is the consummate family business, founded in 1968 by Gimmo Etro and now helmed by his four children: Kean, who designs men’s wear; Jacopo, who designs home goods and accessories; Ippolito, who handles brand strategy; and Veronica, who designs women’s wear. (Even Kean’s 8-year-old daughter, Sofia, sometimes consults on runway soundtracks.) The house is also known for trademarks that include a lust for travel and an eye for jewel tones and florid patterns — especially paisley. But for Etro’s fall 2020 men’s wear show in Milan last weekend, Kean paid particular attention to ancestry, weaving together influences from his Italian heritage and from Argentina, where his wife, Constanza Cavalli Etro, grew up. This synthesis showed up throughout the collection: One model strode down the runway in a jacket that was half leather motorcycle and half wool blanket worn over an ocher turtleneck, while the closing look featured a fringed cape adorned with delicate silver embroidery. And, looming over the runway, was a pinacoteca: a collage of 19th-century portraits, some of them depicting the Etros of centuries past."

He pointed out his favorite piece: a choker made from faux pearls and brass casts of teeth — each one embellished with diamond cavities — that resembled an Edwardian ruffled collar in shape. “It’s our demented version of the iconic pearl necklace,” he said with a grin, “To me, this is like, ‘straight to the museum.’”"

"4071","Defensive end Frank Clark was a great addition for Kansas City this season, but he may have done his team some harm by giving Tennessee running back Derrick Henry some added motivation ahead of this game. Henry has rushed for at least 180 yards in three consecutive games — and ran for 188 yards against Kansas City in Week 10 — but Clark said a running back as large as Henry, who is 6-foot-3 and 247 pounds, should actually run quite a bit harder. “He’s just easy to me up front because I don’t look at any running back like they can’t be tackled,” Clark said. “He’s not one of the best guys at breaking tackles to me, honestly.”"

"4247","OSLO, Norway — Before the woman left for Syria in 2013, she had grown up on the eastern side of Oslo in a Norwegian-Pakistani family, playing soccer and attending university, according to a recent profile. In Syria, she ended up living in Islamic State territory, marrying twice in the Caliphate and having two children, officials say."
"4248","I come from a family of condiment hoarders. We love pickles, spreads, and sauces, but we can’t ever seem to finish them. This used to result in a Jenga-like situation in my fridge, with jars poised to topple out and break a toe every time I reached for the milk."
"4249","In the quick escalation of tensions and attacks between the United States and Iran this month, each side threw down a gauntlet.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, one of the House managers, strode up to the lectern and in somber tones thanked the chief justice, the senators and the White House lawyers.

"4342","Although Burna Boy’s “African Giant” is nominated for best world music album, he’s not staying in any niche. His understated, insinuating rhythms — mixing percussion and electronics — connect to Jamaica, Puerto Rico and American R&B and trap as well as to the Nigerian Afrobeat of Fela Kuti (Burna Boy is from Lagos, Nigeria). Since his debut album in 2013, Burna Boy has recorded alongside Drake, Ed Sheeran, Lily Allen, Stormzy and others. His lyrics, like Fela’s, juggle English and Nigerian languages and patois, as he offers African pride and straightforward history lessons along with tales of night life and romance. JON PARELES"

My husband and I kept our children inside, away from the smoke, while the guilt and fear chipped away at my love for the city. I started to question: Are we supposed to live here? Is there anywhere else we could be happy, safe, productive? My husband helpfully reminded me that the East Coast has snowstorms and hurricanes. We can’t escape climate change — but can we feel more secure?"
"4405","WASHINGTON — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, hails from an era — four years ago — when gaffes could cost a lawmaker a job.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, one of the House managers, strode up to the lectern and in somber tones thanked the chief justice, the senators and the White House lawyers. Then he told a story about running into a fellow New Yorker who asked if he had heard the latest outrage. Mr. Jeffries told the senators that he assumed Mr. Trump, back in town after a trip overseas, had again done something outrageous."

"4418","In 1938, the Philippine president, Manuel L. Quezon, rescued more than 1,200 German Jews from Nazi ghettos and gave them refuge. It’s a remarkable slice of history that seems made for a political thriller: While hatching his rescue plans, Quezon endured internecine conflicts, a relapse of tuberculosis and the final years of American colonial rule in his country. Unfortunately, in Matthew Rosen’s fictionalized take, “Quezon’s Game,” this story of intrigue turns stiff and sentimental."
"4419","For 40 years, a reclusive family in Delhi presented itself as the last surviving heirs to the princely state of Oudh, which once ruled a swath of northern India. The three of them — the mother, and her adult son and daughter — were an incredible story, living in a ruined palace in a forest, a living link to India’s ancient, traumatic past."
"4420","No kindness goes unpunished in “John Henry,” a thug-life thriller so frequently preposterous that it almost resembles a parody. Like “John Wick,” its action is juiced by the killing of a dog; unlike that movie, its titular character (played by the likable Terry Crews) is stoically disinclined to vengeance. A gentle giant with shoulders like an ox, he’s so determined to escape his gangbanging past that when he finally lumbers into action, his weapon of choice is a sledgehammer, not a gun. And his first victim is a car windshield."
"4421","LONDON — ﻿Meghan, Harry. I hear you’re ditching your royal titles and moving to Canada. And why not? You met there, the summers are lovely, and the country is not actively crowdsourcing “bong money” to make sure a big bell goes off at the precise moment it throws itself into international disarray. Plus, there is the matter of your family’s longstanding history as merciless imperialists and a swathe of British citizens and newspapers who, for reasons that couldn’t possibly be racism, have harangued, harassed and libeled you both into the ground. This, combined with how good I know you both look in winter hats, makes me think it will be a very fruitful move indeed."

"4428","Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign has aroused the passions of Democratic voters. Unfortunately for Bloomberg — a formerly Republican, Wall Street-friendly billionaire who, as New York City mayor, supported the racially discriminatory “stop and frisk” policing strategy — those passions are largely negative ones. These personal and ideological priors aside, many Democrats are angry that Bloomberg, who has indicated he is willing to spend as much as $1 billion of his estimated $50 billion fortune on his campaign, seems to be trying to purchase their party’s nomination. The fear is that Bloomberg’s campaign will prolong the Democratic contest and, in the end, produce a hobbled nominee — a nominee who almost certainly won’t be Bloomberg."

When you’re a child, you can learn how to manage conflict, make friends and navigate groups by doing it. But not everyone learns the same lessons the same way. Sometimes, they take a whole lifetime to refine, and many of us never master them."

"4450","The first time I dipped my toe into a world devoid of other people’s opinions was by accident. I’d quit my job after burning out badly (this was a few years before “burnout” had entered the lexicon, and thus I was just crazy), and immediately spent a week giddily driving around the Florida Keys in a red Mustang convertible, top down — a portrait of freedom that instilled envious approval from all those around me.

Many people believe they’re unable to sing in tune, but less than 2 percent of the population exhibits true amusia, or the inability to identify pitch changes in music. If you can hear pitch shifts, you can vocalize them. Think of singing not as some rarefied talent but as part of being human — something most bodies can just do, like walking."

Now he’s back on Minetta Lane, in the former Perla space, where he will showcase his personal take on Italian fare. His wife is the manager. Mr. Toscano strides fearlessly into offal territory with grilled beef tongue, snout-to-tail soup, chicken liver pâté with beef cheeks, and veal head parmigiana, made by using the meat to make a terrine, which is then sliced, breaded and cooked parmigiana-style. “I had not seen anyone do this before,” he said. Several dishes are based on family recipes, like the fideos (angel hair) with skate and chiles. Appetizers include stewed chickpeas, and oysters roasted with crab fat. Baked skate wing, barbecued oxtail and a pork chop wrapped in pork belly are also on the menu. The 62-seat room with an open kitchen is at once rustic and elegant, with bare wood and brick walls against marble, blue velvet, moss-green leather and Art Deco lights. (Opens Friday)"

Schoolchildren are now taught: “Be an upstander, not a bystander!” History, we’re told, shows that, as Edmund Burke supposedly said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” Or in the words of historian Ian Kershaw, “The road to Auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference.” These aphorisms pithily conjure up images of wise men stroking their long white beards, but they’re wrong."

The cavernous 3,600-square-foot space, a former commercial building in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is currently filled with otherworldly figures, their bodies hewn from ancient-looking cork or wood and adorned with swaths of pastel paint or swipes of nail polish.

I am alive because my paternal grandfather’s Spidey sense had him frantically looking for ways out of Germany in 1933. “When madmen are elected, it’s time to leave the country,” he said. Now I, and many others I’m sure, worry that a catastrophe is looming, and wonder how we can guard against it. Schoolchildren are now taught: “Be an upstander, not a bystander!” History, we’re told, shows that, as Edmund Burke supposedly said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” Or in the words of historian Ian Kershaw, “The road to Auschwitz was built by hate but paved with indifference.” These aphorisms pithily conjure up images of wise men stroking their long white beards, but they’re wrong."

The cavernous 3,600-square-foot space, a former commercial building in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is currently filled with otherworldly figures, their bodies hewn from ancient-looking cork or wood and adorned with swaths of pastel paint or swipes of nail polish.

At a news conference in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, a day after being elected, Jeter flashed his famous smile almost nonstop and made perhaps as many jokes in a public setting as he has over the last decade combined."
"4980","DAVOS, Switzerland — This time last year, Juan Guaidó would have been the toast of Davos. Mr. Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, had just led a wave of popular unrest to win the presidency of Venezuela’s National Assembly and declared himself the true leader of his crisis-ridden country."
"4981","This week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts showcased vibrant opinions and discussions.

"4982","House managers had a very clear strategy when they walked into the Senate chambers on Thursday: Poke holes in the defenses they expect President Trump’s lawyers will try to employ when it’s their turn this week."
"4983","Mark it down: The first joke of President Trump’s impeachment trial took place just before 6 p.m. on Thursday. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, one of the House managers, strode up to the lectern and in somber tones thanked the chief justice, the senators and the White House lawyers. Then he told a story about running into a fellow New Yorker who asked if he had heard the latest outrage. Mr. Jeffries told the senators that he assumed Mr. Trump, back in town after a trip overseas, had again done something outrageous."

"4988","Since bail reform began in New York on Jan. 1, opponents have been hard at work to create a backlash against the new law, sometimes wrongly blaming it for the commission of crimes by people they say should have been jailed for earlier offenses, and warning of broad danger to the public."

"4990","A story late in the Chicago author Jasmon Drain’s debut, “Stateway’s Garden,” begins: “Our mothers take credit, but in Stateway we raised ourselves.” It’s a telling sentence, a kind of key to the whole enterprise. We are introduced from the first page to a cast of tenants living in the low-income housing project in the mid-1980s, individuals who recur across the collection, finding different ways to connect, disconnect and let one another down. But, much like the tenement in Gloria Naylor’s “The Women of Brewster Place,” it’s these characters’ living space that is the book’s real protagonist. That is, the high-rises themselves take on traits and modes of agency that shift and evolve from story to story — each time a familiar name is brought back to the stage, he or she feels recontextualized, born anew."
"4991","For a word that suggests as little as possible, so many different things fall under the label of “minimalism” at the moment. A home interior might be described as minimalist if there’s nothing hung on its white walls. A dress is minimalist if it’s simple and functional, or monochrome and expensive. Cleaning out your closet and choosing to consume less is minimalist, but there are also plenty of products you can buy that are “minimalist”: hundreds of lamps, wallets and posters available on Amazon. Avoiding using your phone, checking your email or updating social media is “digital minimalism.” Everything on Instagram seems to be minimalist."

"4994","Baby boomers are such a large group that you can find them practically everywhere in great numbers, including in urban areas. Today in cities, for example, you’re more likely to run into a 54-to-72-year-old with your bike or scooter (please be careful!) than you would have in the past."
"4995","President Trump’s legal team plans to mount an aggressive defense that looks more like offense on Saturday as it opens its side in the Senate impeachment trial by attacking his accusers as partisan witch-hunters trying to remove him because they cannot beat him at the ballot box."

She also quit her job. And she couldn’t be happier. “I’m maybe the best I’ve ever been in my life,” she declares at the beginning of the new, second season. Adapted from Lindy West’s memoir of the same name, the series has been praised for its social commentary, and for Bryant’s performance. “She radiates the wounded hopefulness of someone who’s ready for the next chapter of her life,” Margaret Lyons wrote in her review of Season 1 for The New York Times, “and by the end of the six-episode season, she’s there.” What that next chapter contains is something the second season will have to answer."

It’s a remarkable slice of history that seems made for a political thriller: While hatching his rescue plans, Quezon endured internecine conflicts, a relapse of tuberculosis and the final years of American colonial rule in his country. Unfortunately, in Matthew Rosen’s fictionalized take, “Quezon’s Game,” this story of intrigue turns stiff and sentimental."

Trump’s opponents are suddenly constitutional originalists, seeking to ground their case for impeachment in 18th-century history and founding-era rhetoric.

"5236","STAR TREK: PICARD Stream on CBS All Access. “Tea, Earl Grey, decaf.” That’s Jean-Luc Picard’s new beverage order in “Picard,” the latest “Star Trek” TV series and a return to the franchise for Patrick Stewart, who plays the title character. (For those not hip enough for “Star Trek” references: The order used to be “tea, Earl Grey, hot.”) The new show finds Picard — the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise — in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored “the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary.” Stewart asked, “Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out.”"

"5525","The way things look, President Trump will almost certainly not be removed from office. The precedents set by the articles of impeachment, however, will endure far longer.

In her review for The New York Times, Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that while “The L Word” “now better reflects Los Angeles’s ethnic and gender diversity,” it still needs some fine tuning.

If you and your therapist have mutual respect and trust, but you feel ready to be done, for whatever reason, tell the person. “This could be an amazing opportunity for you to work through an interpersonal strain or conflict as it’s happening,” Eubanks says. Studies show that patients who repaired a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship with their therapist had better psychotherapy outcomes than those who never experienced a breakdown at all."

The boy says, “Androids are trash, but they make a living” — a phrase that comes to me now unbidden as I fall asleep, jolting me awake in a way I imagine is common to unpunished murderers. The woman says that iPhones make a living, too, and asks, “You ready to cash out?” Then it’s over."

The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in “The Curse of La Llorona,” a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the film’s title: She’s cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) “More efficient than ambitious, ‘La Llorona’ is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.” One of the movie’s producers is James Wan, known for the “Saw” and “Conjuring” movies.

But isn’t it unfair to ask us to change without asking the same of the children or their parents?"

He tells his friend that he’s going on a date with a shiksa, one who has been asking him penetrating questions. “Wait a minute,” the friend responds. “Is she a writer?”"

"7213","THE CURSE OF LA LLORONA (2019) Stream on HBO platforms. The threat is veiled (in the literal sense) in “The Curse of La Llorona,” a horror movie about a killer spirit who takes the form of a weeping woman in a wedding dress. The movie casts Linda Cardellini as Anna, a widow with two children, a job in social services and a problem audiences can probably extrapolate from the film’s title: She’s cursed. Or, rather, she picks up a curse that comes in the form of La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman who starts terrorizing the family. (The character is based on a figure from Mexican folklore.) “More efficient than ambitious, ‘La Llorona’ is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely.” One of the movie’s producers is James Wan, known for the “Saw” and “Conjuring” movies.
