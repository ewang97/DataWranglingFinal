It follows Joseph on a path of despair — and eventual reconciliation."

The management company would not disclose where in the building the resident lives, or if the person used any building amenities before testing positive.

In his captivating new book, “The Painted Bunting’s Last Molt,” Virgil Suárez examines the mixed brew of childhood memory, exile, ornithology, contrasts and conflicts that build a life. His eye remains tuned to details, turning them over like shining geodes. The darkly humorous twists of “Bad Sons Anonymous” remind us that it’s never just one clear story.

"632","INVISIBLE LIFE (2019) Stream on Amazon. Two inseparable sisters are torn apart in “Invisible Life,” a drama from the Brazilian director Karim Aïnouz. Based on a popular novel by Martha Batalha and set in early 1950s Rio de Janeiro, the film begins by introducing the siblings, their tight relationship and their differing desires. Guida (Julia Stockler) has fallen for a Greek sailor; Eurídice (Carol Duarte) wants to pursue a career as a pianist. Then Guida elopes, Eurídice is pushed to marry and it becomes unclear whether the sisters will ever see each other again. That separation is largely due to their father, who lies to keep them apart. The film won the Un Certain Regard award at the Cannes Film Festival last year, and has done well with critics. In his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny called it “a modern melodrama that’s proud to be one,” adding that the film’s “mix of vivid period detail and raw frankness about sexuality and poverty and women’s oppression is heady and bracing; its depiction of female friendship and love is pointedly ferocious.”"

Williams) and Thor (Brady Noon). The trouble starts when they spy on the teenage girls next door with Max’s father’s drone. What follows is one misadventure after another, involving drugs, sex toys, frat boys and a whole lot of cursing. “Good Boys” opened to generally positive reviews last summer.

For one drink, you need two ounces of the gin in a mixing glass, along with a half-ounce each of Campari, Pineau des Charentes or white Lillet, and grapefruit liqueur, plus two dashes of Peychaud’s bitters. Stir well with ice, then strain into a double rocks glass with fresh ice. You can garnish with a strip of citrus peel or, as I have done, a stirrer cut from a stalk of rhubarb.

The maternity ward delivers many hundreds of babies every week, and the World Health Organization estimates that in sub-Saharan Africa, infections acquired in the hospital cause 75 percent of newborn deaths for hospital-born babies."

Despite all the chaos outside, here, online, was a safe harbor. The only thing contagious was the mood, which was jubilant.

Then I went home and made sourdough pineapple muffins, riffing off Marian Burros’s elegant recipe for the blueberry ones they used to make at Jordan Marsh in Boston. This was not like me to do, for I’m not generally a baker and rarely an improvisatory one. But they were light and sweet and a little salty, and the children were pleased not to face a bowl of cereal again, the same scrambled eggs, the same heel of toast, the breakfast monotony of a life spent schooling and working and living at home."
"1507","LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday evening after 10 days of battling the coronavirus, unnerving a country that had gathered to watch Queen Elizabeth II rally fellow Britons to confront the pandemic and reassure them that when the crisis finally ebbed, “we will meet again.”"

And of course, it’s about my mother, and maybe about her generation, which certainly grew up through scary times, and about thinking of our own children, all of them, their childhoods interrupted — at any age — by Covid-19 and by our own scary times."

The mobile network Vodafone reported a 50 percent surge in internet use last month, and all over the world internet companies are being forced to deal with the extra demand generated by self-isolation.

"1542","Lamb for Easter, or just because it’s spring, comes with a bonus from D’Artagnan. With the purchase of three racks, you also get a bottle of fine French olive oil from the property of the French movie star Jean Reno. Cooking a rack of lamb is a no-brainer. You can coat the fat with herbed bread crumbs moistened with mustard, if you wish, then put the rack, crumb-side up, in a roasting pan. It takes just 25 to 30 minutes in a 425-degree oven for medium-rare to medium."
"1543","An uncommon addition to your vinegar collection comes from Sirk in Friuli, a region in northeast Italy. Like traditional balsamic vinegar, Sirk is made from grapes, not wine, the base for many vinegars. But the similarity ends there. Ribolla Gialla white grapes, prized for winemaking in the region, are macerated and slowly allowed to ferment with their skins for a year. White grapes and skin contact is why the makers, according to Beatrice Ughi, who imports it for her company, Gustiamo, call it the “orange wine” of vinegars. The fermented juice then spends several years in small oak barrels to evolve into the delicately fruity pinkish vinegar. It’s a finishing vinegar; the smaller size is a slender spray bottle."

What sets serious ramen apart is the deeply flavored, long-simmered broth, infusing all the components — vegetables, meats, eggs, tofu, seasonings and of course, noodles — with soulful richness.

The alternative is ordering ramen from the experts, for delivery or pickup. Consider requesting that the noodles be packed separately, so you can boil them in your kitchen and add them to the dishes.

When she moved into her two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a handsome Victorian terrace house in Earl’s Court in 2011, she discovered two unappealing brushed-metal table lamps that had been wired into the fitted alcove cabinets of her living room by a previous owner. Rather than reaching for a screwdriver, she set about reinventing them with a cache of plaster strips left over from an art project she’d completed during her time at the London College of Communication. Inspired first by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti’s 1930s Tête de Femme lamps, shaped like semi-abstracted female figures, and later by the idea of a fragile flower, she began layering the nondescript bases with the soft, water-soaked gauze. The resulting sculptures are naïve and enchanting: One depicts a woman’s face, its features smoothed and barely discernible, like those of a timeworn marble sculpture; the other evokes a bloom with delicately layered petals, their alabaster white surface mottled by the marks of the artist’s hand."

"1813","During most of his life Henry David Thoreau was, by conventional standards of success, a failure. He rarely left the farm town of Concord, Mass., where he was born in 1817. There he was viewed by at least some of his neighbors as a marginal figure, standoffish, politically radical, a loner, a crank. As a member of the New England literary world he cut a graceless figure and had an inauspicious professional start."

"1816","For the Italian-born, London-based artist and designer Viola Lanari, creativity is often fueled by a hunt for solutions. When she moved into her two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a handsome Victorian terrace house in Earl’s Court in 2011, she discovered two unappealing brushed-metal table lamps that had been wired into the fitted alcove cabinets of her living room by a previous owner. Rather than reaching for a screwdriver, she set about reinventing them with a cache of plaster strips left over from an art project she’d completed during her time at the London College of Communication. Inspired first by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti’s 1930s Tête de Femme lamps, shaped like semi-abstracted female figures, and later by the idea of a fragile flower, she began layering the nondescript bases with the soft, water-soaked gauze. The resulting sculptures are naïve and enchanting: One depicts a woman’s face, its features smoothed and barely discernible, like those of a timeworn marble sculpture; the other evokes a bloom with delicately layered petals, their alabaster white surface mottled by the marks of the artist’s hand."

Every Saturday I shopped along a stretch of Ninth Avenue around the Port Authority Bus Terminal, in Manhattan. In those years, it wasn’t the best part of town, but to me, an adventurous fledging cook, the small shops were as thrilling as a grand bazaar. There was a spice shop where I could buy saffron by the pinch for paella and risotto. A store where I bought handmade phyllo to make spanakopita and baklava. There was a fishmonger who sold everything that went into a bouillabaisse, including an assortment of heads and bones to make the broth, and a butcher who learned about charcuterie in France after the war. He made pâtés like the ones I saw in Gourmet magazine, and had duck confit and sausages for cassoulet; I bought the classic beans — creamy white ones from Tarbes — at a market opposite the terminal.

"1944","When I started cooking, I would spend hours during the week thinking about what I wanted to make over the weekend, and then I would spend the weekend making it.

There was a spice shop where I could buy saffron by the pinch for paella and risotto. A store where I bought handmade phyllo to make spanakopita and baklava. There was a fishmonger who sold everything that went into a bouillabaisse, including an assortment of heads and bones to make the broth, and a butcher who learned about charcuterie in France after the war. He made pâtés like the ones I saw in Gourmet magazine, and had duck confit and sausages for cassoulet; I bought the classic beans — creamy white ones from Tarbes — at a market opposite the terminal. That’s also where I got the rice for the risotto."

At seven fifteen every morning you see him set out on his run. Along about ten or ten thirty he slaps the magnetic TECH HERMIT sign onto the roof of his Kia. The times he leaves on his calls will vary, but not a day seems to go by without several clients requiring his services. Afternoons he can be spotted working around the apartment building; he moonlights as the super. He’ll be sweeping the walk or shaking out the mat or conferring with a plumber.

(Even those of us who tend naturally toward solitary endeavors find ourselves running low on interiority these days.) Under normal circumstances, illness is a largely private event; even a common disease is suffered individually. But a pandemic isolates us collectively, as the grid illustrates almost too perfectly; we aren’t alone in our loneliness. When we Zoom, we “connect” along our metaphoric edges. We’ve existed in such grids for a while without really acknowledging it, one might argue, imprisoned in our small geometries of perspective. Grid life seems all too easy a metaphor for a society stripped bare, exposed for what it has become. But that’s the thing about the grid; live with it long enough and one forgets it’s there, until the next catastrophe."

But when it does, we sometimes wake, in a mortal panic, with hypochondriac symptoms we feel to be real but we know are not; and then we feel selfishly stupid for having them in the first place.

This absurd and absurdist series, about a 30-story elementary school with one classroom on each floor, has seen a new addition only once every decade or two since its inception in 1978, but it has still generated enough fan-feeding mythology to fill its own wiki. While it’s certainly not impossible for “Cloud of Doom” to serve as an introduction for newcomers, it is eminently more enjoyable as a follow-up."

I’m seven months pregnant and terrified of delivering in the city during the coronavirus pandemic. We want to break our lease and stay with my parents upstate since we’re both working remotely anyway. But our landlord says unless we can find someone to take over the lease, he won’t let us out of it. What can we do?"
"2275","The news media business was shaky before the coronavirus started spreading across the country last month.

"2276","Waiting backstage for my name to be called, I started feeling the familiar flutter of butterflies. It caught me off guard, because I thought I’d conquered my public speaking nerves. In the span of a decade, I’d gone from shaking in front of a classroom to calmly delivering keynote speeches for audiences of 20,000. It was supposed to be anxiety then, serenity now."

"2338","TORONTO — “Welcome to the running of the anti-feminists,” said Coco Francini, an executive producer of FX’s new limited series “Mrs. America.” Behind her, in the parking lot of an amusement park outside Toronto, dozens of background actors dressed tidily in pea coats and pumps milled about holding handmade signs blaring, “Lesbians go home” and “Read the Bible while you’re able!”"
"2339","WASHINGTON — Exactly one month after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, two senior senators proposed the creation of an entirely new government department that would pull together the diverse, often competitive federal agencies whose lack of communication and coordination left the nation exposed to deadly terrorism on American soil. It became the Department of Homeland Security."
"2340","In these housebound times, Americans have gone stark baking mad. Shut-ins are channeling their anxieties into pandemic pastries and quarantine cookies, some with icing piped in the shape of surgical masks, others frosted with the face of Dr. Anthony Fauci. Baking essentials such as yeast and flour are in short supply, and Google searches for bread recipes are on the rise, so to speak."
"2341","Watching my 3-year-old become a geography expert over the last few weeks has taken my mom guilt from an occasional pang to a chronic panic attack. While I’m thrilled he can tell me that Tegucigalpa is the capital of Honduras, his lonely excursion through geography apps concerns me. As a marriage and family therapist, I worry that social distancing might cause my only child to draw deeper into himself, maybe even trigger long-term anxiety or depression."
"2342","Across the United States, black and Hispanic people suffer disproportionately from poverty, poor health care and chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and asthma."
"2343","Self-quarantine can be an opportunity to make the most of a sedentary day. Learn a new language online. Take up knitting. Get through that stack of books you have been meaning to read."
"2344","Life is just one playlist away from being perfectly soundtracked."
"2345","Cathy Cichowski was trying to get from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to San Antonio, where her job in a hospital involves workplace safety.

"2346","When we asked readers what they still wished to know about exercising during the coronavirus crisis, one issue topped all others. People wondered about running or cycling in a face mask and how it would affect their breathing, performance, chances of spreading the virus and even vision."
"2347","The first-year football coach at Mississippi State University has been reprimanded and must visit a civil rights museum after he recently shared a meme on Twitter of a woman knitting a noose, the university’s athletic director said this week."

"2349","This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays."
"2350","Crates of masks snatched from cargo planes on airport tarmacs. Countries paying triple the market price to outbid others. Accusations of “modern piracy” against governments trying to secure medical supplies for their own people."
"2351","WASHINGTON — In his daily briefings on the coronavirus, President Trump has brandished all the familiar tools in his rhetorical arsenal: belittling Democratic governors, demonizing the media, trading in innuendo and bulldozing over the guidance of experts."
"2352","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) "
"2353","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, under fire for pushing food stamp cuts in the middle of a pandemic, has decided to hold off on stricter work requirements for adults without children during the national emergency."

"2355","I confess: I don’t typically like listening to excerpts from extended works. Nor do I enjoy hearing other compositions sandwiched between different movements of a major piece. (Just play something whole — and then do something else!)  "
"2356","Three tubs of absentee ballots that never reached voters were discovered in a postal center outside Milwaukee. At least 9,000 absentee ballots requested by voters were never sent, and others recorded as sent were never received. Even when voters did return their completed ballots in the mail, thousands were postmarked too late to count — or not at all."
"2357","ISTANBUL — During a tumultuous day in court in February, the Turkish businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala was unexpectedly acquitted of trying to overthrow the government and then rearrested before he could walk free."
"2358","ATLANTA — Months before the coronavirus arrived in the South, before it raced across rural communities and larger cities alike, sickening scores of vulnerable residents, Johnny Presley bought a shuttered 33-bed hospital."
"2359","President Trump said that if the United States switched to all-mail voting, “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”"
"2360","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The photographs are hardly Instagram-worthy, with their retro rowing machines and dull home-gym-looking backdrops. But, according to prosecutors in the nation’s largest college admissions scandal, they served their purpose — to further a lie."
"2361","About two weeks ago, New Jersey’s governor, Philip D. Murphy, urged residents with second homes not to decamp to the shore."
"2362","When the retirement expert Alicia H. Munnell finished gathering data for a study on American workers ages 50 to 62 in jobs without benefits, she was stunned."
"2363","The federal government is struggling to deliver financial aid to faltering employers — and workers are suffering the consequences. Roughly 10 percent of American workers filed for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks, a wave of job losses that has no precedent in modern American history. Millions more are struggling to submit unemployment claims to overwhelmed state agencies. And still more face the loss of their jobs in the coming weeks."
"2364","Writing in The New York Times 150 years ago this April 11, Frederick Douglass celebrated the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which at long last banned racial discrimination in voting nationwide.

"2367","During most of his life Henry David Thoreau was, by conventional standards of success, a failure. He rarely left the farm town of Concord, Mass., where he was born in 1817. There he was viewed by at least some of his neighbors as a marginal figure, standoffish, politically radical, a loner, a crank. As a member of the New England literary world he cut a graceless figure and had an inauspicious professional start."
"2368","JERUSALEM — For five years, a small but feisty group of Palestinian peace activists in the blockaded Gaza Strip has been organizing small-scale video chats with Israelis under a bridge-building initiative it calls “Skype With Your Enemy.”"
"2369","MALACCA, Malaysia — About the fastest moving force these days in the old Portuguese Settlement of Malacca is the sweat trickling down the torsos of the underemployed."
"2370","OMAHA — The former rail route known as the Field Club Trail is a beautiful, popular pathway here. Wide and meandering with nearly two miles of paved trail through historic neighborhoods and verdant forests, this connective artery has allowed people to explore midtown for some 25 years. On a recent warm afternoon, with everything newly green, the trail looked like heaven for everyone enjoying nature’s splendor after a long and disheartening winter."
"2371","On Sundays, the Rev. Mario Powell, who is almost certainly the city’s youngest African-American Jesuit priest, would typically crisscross the city, celebrating Mass with congregations in Harlem and Downtown Brooklyn."
"2372","In mid-March, Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey announced the first coronavirus-linked death in the Northeast. Since then, there have been more than 16,000 virus-related deaths in the United States, and the toll grows by the hour."
"2373","In American cities, busy streets fuel commerce and sustain the background noise to everyday life. Their emptiness today, as a pandemic races across the country, stands as a grim marker of the peril of our times."

"2375","NOVATO, Calif. — A white 2019 Audi A8 L sedan with extra fuel tanks in the trunk pulled away from a Midtown Manhattan parking garage late last Saturday night. A driver on a high-speed mission aimed the car west and hit the accelerator."
"2376","MADISON, Wis. — The Wisconsin State Legislature couldn’t agree on who to honor for Black History Month. It couldn’t hold a special session on gun violence that lasted more than a few seconds. It had stalled for weeks on releasing money to help farmers struggling with mental health issues."
"2377","LONDON — It may seem unlikely that a country known for being buttoned-up would turn to a man dancing in a multicolored unitard for reassurance and inspiration. Yet each morning recently, about 1.6 million people in Britain have been tuning in to watch Mr. Motivator, real name Derrick Evans, on a BBC program called “Healthcheck U.K. Live.”"
"2378","BEIJING — Chinese officials have begun inspecting every shipment of N95 respirators, ventilators and other medical supplies for quality issues before export, a policy likely to delay the arrival of critical gear at hospitals around the world that are struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic."

"2381","At Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Brooklyn, workers said they had to convert a room into a makeshift morgue after more than 15 residents died of the coronavirus, and funeral homes could not handle all the bodies."
"2382","We had our first Zoom Seder this week. I had never hosted Passover in my home, so we had zero essentials and, though I tried to get what I could at the store, a lamb shank is not easy to come by in this particular moment. So, my kids drew the big bone and the gefilte fish on a piece of paper, and my 3-year-old insisted on eating a tortilla with ketchup instead of matzo. We read from a PDF Haggadah I found on Reform Judaism dot org. And you know what? It was still pretty special."
"2383","A once-in-a-century public health crisis is unfolding, and the richest country in the world is struggling to mount an effective response. Hospitals don’t have enough gowns or masks to protect doctors and nurses, nor enough intensive care beds to treat the surge of patients. Laboratories don’t have the equipment to diagnose cases quickly or in bulk, and state and local health departments across the country don’t have the manpower to track the disease’s spread. Perhaps worst of all, urgent messages about the importance of social distancing and the need for temporary shutdowns have been muddied by politics."
"2384","WASHINGTON — Top White House advisers as well as experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies all sounded alarms and urged aggressive action to counter the threat from the coronavirus, but President Trump remained slow to respond, a detailed examination of the government’s response found."

"2387","To the Editor:"
"2388","Every night at 7, my Brooklyn neighborhood comes to life with the calculated whimsy of a cuckoo clock. It starts with a single neighbor clapping. Soon dozens more join in, throwing open their front doors or hanging from their windows to put their hands together and say “wooooo.” Perhaps 20 seconds into the proceedings, a man emerges from the garden apartment across from me, banging a pot with a spoon, and a woman appears on the stoop of the house next door, her spaniel barking helpfully at her side. Often there is a special guest: On a recent evening, a guy motored by on a delivery bike, a whistle blaring from between his lips. It’s all over within five minutes."
"2389","The politics of the coronavirus have made it seem indecent to talk about the future. As President Trump has flirted with reopening America quickly — saying in late March that he’d like to see “packed churches” on Easter and returning to the theme days ago with “we cannot let this continue” — public-health experts have felt compelled to call out the dangers. Many Americans have responded by rejecting as monstrous the whole idea of any trade-off between saving lives and saving the economy. And in the near term, it’s true that those two goals align: For the sake of both, it’s imperative to keep businesses shuttered and people in their homes as much as possible."
"2390","As the coronavirus pandemic forces schools and college campuses to go online, the delivery model of education — largely unchanged for centuries — has suddenly been disrupted."
"2391","In mid-March, Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey announced the first coronavirus-linked death in the Northeast. Since then, there have been more than 16,000 virus-related deaths in the United States, and the toll grows by the hour."

"2394","MIAMI — You could find Beatriz Diaz at this spring’s Winter Party Festival in Miami Beach, giving out hand sanitizer."
"2395","VINNYTSIA, Ukraine — Firefighters have struggled to control wildfires burning through radioactive forest in the abandoned territory around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, where radiation levels are considerably lower than they were immediately after the 1986 accident but still pose risks."
"2396","At Crown Heights Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Brooklyn, workers said they had to convert a room into a makeshift morgue after more than 15 residents died of the coronavirus, and funeral homes could not handle all the bodies."
"2397","A portrait of a vulnerable America."
"2398","WASHINGTON — Top White House advisers as well as experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies all sounded alarms and urged aggressive action to counter the threat from the coronavirus, but President Trump remained slow to respond, a detailed examination of the government’s response found."
"2399","The popularity of the long-running animated series “The Simpsons,” “South Park” and “Family Guy” defied the common perception that cartoons are just for kids. In fact, some of the best American animated shows of recent years have featured cultural references and subject matter best appreciated by viewers who’ve lived long enough to get the jokes — and who are mature enough to understand the emotions and experiences the series’ creators are exploring."

"2401","Guiding a state like Montana through a pandemic is difficult because Montana is a complicated state in a precarious position. Its significant Indigenous population is spread across seven reservations whose resources are spread thin even in non-pandemic times. When bidding on critical resources, the state can’t compete with the bigger needs of coastal states like New York or California."
"2402","Americans are rapidly losing faith in President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to national polls released over the past week."
"2403","OMAHA — Beginning every morning at 5:30, Dr. Andre Kalil makes himself a double espresso, runs 10 kilometers, makes additional double espressos for himself and his wife, and heads to his office at the University of Nebraska Medical Center."
"2404","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) "
"2405","BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Every morning at a school in the vast desert along the Colombian coast, 40 children, all part of the country’s largest Indigenous group, the Wayuu, gather before class for breakfast."
"2406","Joseph R. Biden Jr. took some of his first steps to bring together the Democratic Party now that he is its presumptive presidential nominee, announcing proposals on Thursday to lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 60 and to expand student debt forgiveness programs for low-income and middle-class families."
"2407","Bruce Baillie, who personified the Bay Area experimental cinema of the 1960s as an independent filmmaker and consummate 16-millimeter craftsman whose most extraordinary movie is a single panning shot, died on Friday at his home on Camano Island, Wash. He was 88."
"2408","Marina Abramovic has pulled off some crazy feats."
"2409","I’m a big fan of awful first drafts. All of my writing (even this article) starts with an incriminatingly bad first draft, riddled with typos and clichés, grammatical errors and half-finished sentences. No one else sees those drafts. I tear up that awful first draft and start again — and that’s when things start to click. That’s when sentences start to flow coherently, when ideas and themes make sense, and when the real work gets done."

That led to led this sequel, which picks up 27 years after the events of the first movie. The seven friends of the Losers Club reunite in their picturesque town of Derry, Me. All have seemingly moved on from their traumas involving It — the supernatural killer that takes the form of Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgard) — except for Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), who has been obsessively researching ways to stop It for good. Flashbacks of the friends’ encounters with It resurface from years ago, and each of them have to confront demons that were long buried. Some critics praised the cast — which also includes Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Jay Ryan, James Ransone and Andy Bean — but said the scares are underwhelming."

Around that time, during a dinner party, I laughed when a friend quipped: “How do you eat a pangolin anyway? Do you dip its scales in butter like an artichoke?” When I tweeted that same joke the next day, a writer I knew responded, “It’s used for medicinal purposes.” He was simply stating a fact, but I suddenly realized that I could be spreading stereotypes about Chinese people. I deleted the tweet with a reminder to self: Make fun of Asians only around other Asians."

But instead of making cranes or flowers, she preferred to transform the sheets of printed paper into utilitarian objects, like boxes. “There was something about the ingenuity of a flat object being folded up to be 3-D in order to hold something,” says Ping, 41. One day, inspired by Angus MacGyver, the resourceful secret agent and titular character of the 1980s television series — “He was always finding solutions with little more than chewing gum and a toothpick,” says Ping — she folded a paper tea set for her dolls. “My mom was so annoyed,” she says of the water-soaked mess that ensued. Another creation that stands out in Ping’s mind is a paper boat she made, and that her father, who’d trained as a mechanical engineer, improved upon with side panels made from leftover paper — suddenly, the ordinary canoe was a catamaran. “It even had a canopy,” Ping recalls. “I was like, Oh my god. That probably informed a lot of how my brain works.”"

The franchise’s new offering starts off with a two-hour episode, and follows musicians looking for love. It should be diverting enough to help viewers forget that the most recent bachelor didn’t end his season betrothed. At the very least, it will tide us over until Clare Crawley assumes “The Bachelorette” throne. The spinoff’s contestants will perform separately and together as they try to develop ongoing relationships."

His own apartment was a nine-thousand-square-foot glass box in the sky. (“Nobody has ever seen a room this big, with this high a ceiling, with this much glass.”) Trump’s divorce lawyer came to the party, but Marla Maples, whom Trump had separated from, stayed home. The tower had been built into the skeleton of an old office building, swaddled in bronze reflective glass. “It looks cheap.” “It’s Miami Beach.” “It’s really awful.” “Why didn’t you warn us?” angry New Yorkers asked Herbert Muschamp, The New York Times’s architectural critic.

He has said that his grandmother’s puchero, made from vegetables and cheap cuts of meat, is the first dish that he remembers eating. Other staples of her kitchen were a lentil soup with plantains and bacon and a vegetable soup made with potatoes, carrots, zucchini and whatever else was good and in season. “My grandfather really liked soups, so we always had them at home,” Olvera says. “He found them heartwarming.”"

Fighting her on the “for” side are a cadre of figures from the left, including Gloria Steinem (Rose Byrne), Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba), Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) and Bella Abzug (Margo Martindale). The show tells stories from both sides, as it chronicles events leading up to the defeat of the E.R.A. — a defeat, led by Schlafly, that had lasting effects. “Love her or hate her, you cannot not take away that she was extraordinary,” the series’s creator, Dahvi Waller, a former “Mad Men” writer, said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “And if you find yourself rooting for her and hate yourself for it, that’s also fun.”"

"3753","Just a few months after the Sept. 11 attack, I joined the office of Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York as deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, responsible for the city’s economic recovery. The predictions were dire. The New York Times warned of a return to the tough times of the 1970s, when austerity, crime and poverty led to a “plummet in the quality of life so sharp that people fled town.”"
"3754","“LETTERS ARE ABOVE all useful as a means of expressing the ideal self; and no other method of communication is quite so good for this purpose,” wrote the novelist and critic Elizabeth Hardwick in a 1953 essay about literary correspondence. “In conversation, those uneasy eyes upon you, those lips ready with an emendation before you have begun to speak, are a powerful deterrent to unreality, even to hope.” Only in our letters are we able to frame our cleverest selves, to pose both the questions and answers, to make ourselves known as we wish to be known. Those of us experiencing a serious uptick in our email correspondence right now — it seems all it took for us to re-embrace the epistolary form was a global pandemic — are freshly acquainted with the clever breeziness, the missives framed as “just checking in,” from people we once knew far better than we do now."
"3755","It’s April, so I must be writing about “Bosch.” This is the fifth straight year I’ve taken note of a new season (now the sixth) of Amazon Prime Video’s Los Angeles cop show based on Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch novels.

Apple has never been timid; even on her 1996 debut album, released when she was a teenager, her songs explored psychological minefields and spared no one. But “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” is daring in a new way, scrambling and shattering the pop-song structures that once grounded her."

We know this if we’ve studied evolution. It was Darwin’s great achievement to explain the adaptation of organisms without appeal to God’s design or mystical idealism.

At the time, there was only one fertility-preservation possibility for women who faced sterility from damaging treatments like chemotherapy and radiology: to freeze embryos beforehand. For single women, that meant a flurry of rushed decision-making. They’d have to choose donor sperm in the short window they had leading up to cancer treatment. Men, on the other hand, could freeze their sperm easily, an option widely available since the 1970s. “Why is it that she couldn’t have this when it was available to men?” Dr. Gook recalled thinking."

"3978","THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe are given little but each other for company in “The Lighthouse.” The film casts that pair as Winslow and Wake, two 19th-century lighthouse keepers on a small, secluded island off the New England coast. It’s a claustrophobic experience for the characters and audiences alike: Directed by Robert Eggers and filmed in black-and-white, the grimly funny film shows the two men spending their days fighting and drinking, growing closer together even as they antagonize each other. The plot “is thin enough to invite plentiful interpretations about masculinity, homosocial relations and desire,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. The movie’s “more sustained pleasures,” she added, “are its form and style, its presumptive influences (von Stroheim’s ‘Greed,’ German Expressionism), the frowning curve of Winslow’s mustache, the whites of eyes rolled back in terror.”"

"3986","#BLACKAF Stream on Netflix. “We’re celebrating my dad’s new Netflix show,” Drea (Iman Benson) says at the self-referential beginning of this new sitcom. “I don’t know exactly what it’s about, but pretty sure it has something to do with black stuff.” Created by the screenwriter Kenya Barris (“black-ish,” “Girls Trip”), “#blackAF” stars Barris as a fictionalized, exaggerated version of himself. The show’s Kenya is a successful, cynical screenwriter living an extravagant Los Angeles life and raising children with his wife, played by Rashida Jones. The show explores issues of race, class and wealth — with family dynamics that should resonate well beyond the story’s rarefied setting. “Most families are functionally dysfunctional,” Barris said in a recent interview about the show with The New York Times. “You want the house to be a little bit messy,” he added. “You want the mom to be a little bit frayed. The dad to be a bit out of touch. Some of those things are just part of what family is. I want people to realize that that dysfunction is part of our functionality.”"

"4165","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and paper—not the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street. My mother, who still only half-jokingly called herself Monir Farahani Ed Dowleh—this last obsolete suffix a reference to her supposed aristocratic heritage—endured his mania with the pragmatism of a jockey putting up with her thoroughbred’s quirks. Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldn’t tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbas–style mustache who was our family’s supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him “Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab.” This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my father’s birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named “Shatt al-Arab” by our Arab neighbors and “Arvand Roud” by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmother’s province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land."

"4213","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and paper—not the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street.

Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldn’t tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbas–style mustache who was our family’s supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him “Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab.” This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my father’s birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named “Shatt al-Arab” by our Arab neighbors and “Arvand Roud” by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmother’s province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land."

"4469","By 18 months, your child is probably able to walk easily and even run with a smoother gait than at 15 months. At this point, the neural pathways that coordinate motor control and balance have become stronger and more refined, meaning your toddler can adapt to uneven surfaces without losing much speed. Children at this age can typically get down stairs safely, either by scooting or holding on to a railing, and going one stair at a time. But they do not yet have the strength or coordination to go down stairs with alternating feet, and they still need careful supervision. They should also be able to throw a ball, an act that takes considerable coordination of different muscle groups."

Those of us experiencing a serious uptick in our email correspondence right now — it seems all it took for us to re-embrace the epistolary form was a global pandemic — are freshly acquainted with the clever breeziness, the missives framed as “just checking in,” from people we once knew far better than we do now."

At the time, there was only one fertility-preservation possibility for women who faced sterility from damaging treatments like chemotherapy and radiology: to freeze embryos beforehand. For single women, that meant a flurry of rushed decision-making. They’d have to choose donor sperm in the short window they had leading up to cancer treatment. Men, on the other hand, could freeze their sperm easily, an option widely available since the 1970s. “Why is it that she couldn’t have this when it was available to men?” Dr. Gook recalled thinking."

"4555","AUSTIN CITY LIMITS 11 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This live music show is resurfacing an episode from 2018 to honor the Grammy-winning folk singer-songwriter John Prine, who died of complications from the coronavirus on April 7 at the age of 73. Prine was revered by Bob Dylan, and in 2019, was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. This performance, his eighth and final for “Austin City Limits,” came 40 years after he made his debut on the show in 1978. It features a few classics, such as “Illegal Smile,” off Prine’s debut record; “Lake Marie,” from 1995’s “Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings,” and seven tracks from his final album, “The Tree of Forgiveness,” including “When I Get to Heaven.” It’s a joyful farewell, in which Prine makes peace with mortality and sings: “When I get to heaven, I’m gonna shake God’s hand/Thank him for more blessings than one man can stand/Then I’m gonna get a guitar and start a rock-n-roll band.”"

"4581","Eva Holland grew up “carrying, as most of us do, a quiver of assorted fears,” she writes in her new book, “Nerve: Adventures in the Science of Fear.” But chief among them was the fear of losing her mother. She felt confident that such a loss could be a “life-destroying force,” since she saw her mother still broken by the death of her own mother when she was a child. In “Nerve,” Holland also writes intimately about her fears of falling, of heights and, after she was involved in traumatic accidents, of driving. And she writes about the science behind those fears and the methods she and others have used to try to overcome them, including a therapy called E.M.D.R., or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Below, Holland talks about the scary day when she decided to write the book, the progress she made on her fears and how action movies have taught her some things about writing."
"4582","By 18 months, your child is probably able to walk easily and even run with a smoother gait than at 15 months. At this point, the neural pathways that coordinate motor control and balance have become stronger and more refined, meaning your toddler can adapt to uneven surfaces without losing much speed. Children at this age can typically get down stairs safely, either by scooting or holding on to a railing, and going one stair at a time. But they do not yet have the strength or coordination to go down stairs with alternating feet, and they still need careful supervision. They should also be able to throw a ball, an act that takes considerable coordination of different muscle groups."

"4585","“LETTERS ARE ABOVE all useful as a means of expressing the ideal self; and no other method of communication is quite so good for this purpose,” wrote the novelist and critic Elizabeth Hardwick in a 1953 essay about literary correspondence. “In conversation, those uneasy eyes upon you, those lips ready with an emendation before you have begun to speak, are a powerful deterrent to unreality, even to hope.” Only in our letters are we able to frame our cleverest selves, to pose both the questions and answers, to make ourselves known as we wish to be known. Those of us experiencing a serious uptick in our email correspondence right now — it seems all it took for us to re-embrace the epistolary form was a global pandemic — are freshly acquainted with the clever breeziness, the missives framed as “just checking in,” from people we once knew far better than we do now."
"4586","In 1813, Beethoven wrote a symphonic work so noisy and trite that most scholars consider it an embarrassment. “Wellington’s Victory, or the Battle of Vitoria” depicts, with the help of spatially separated brass and percussion effects, a rout of French forces at the hands of the British."

The ingredients and measurements remain the same each day, but they react to the yeast and the lactobaccili in the starter in singular ways, every time. There’s something emotionally helpful about that for anyone housebound and prone to dark moods, this chance to observe dough and therefore life as a farmer does her fields each morning, as a clammer does his patch of water and mud. There’s wonder everywhere, if only you look for it. Look for it. It might be in a tree outside your window, in the patch of sky you can see if you crane your neck, in the herbs you’re growing, in the nest the swans are building on that open stretch of marsh across the street.

There’s something emotionally helpful about that for anyone housebound and prone to dark moods, this chance to observe dough and therefore life as a farmer does her fields each morning, as a clammer does his patch of water and mud. There’s wonder everywhere, if only you look for it. Look for it.

"4765","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and paper—not the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street. My mother, who still only half-jokingly called herself Monir Farahani Ed Dowleh—this last obsolete suffix a reference to her supposed aristocratic heritage—endured his mania with the pragmatism of a jockey putting up with her thoroughbred’s quirks. Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldn’t tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbas–style mustache who was our family’s supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him “Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab.” This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my father’s birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named “Shatt al-Arab” by our Arab neighbors and “Arvand Roud” by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmother’s province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land."

Before the sixth and final season debuted last fall, the writers wrote off one of the main characters, played by Jussie Smollett, who is being investigated for potentially staging a hate crime he himself reported. Now, the series is ending earlier than planned because production shut down before the final two episodes could be completed. This episode will have to tie up a few loose ends: While Bossyfest opens, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) tries to regain control of Empire. Lucious (Howard) contemplates his feelings for her while still supporting Yana (Kiandra Richardson). And, since flashbacks from earlier episodes showed grim endings for Cookie and Lucious, it’s clear the Lyon family is still in hot water."

"5043","Eva Holland grew up “carrying, as most of us do, a quiver of assorted fears,” she writes in her new book, “Nerve: Adventures in the Science of Fear.” But chief among them was the fear of losing her mother. She felt confident that such a loss could be a “life-destroying force,” since she saw her mother still broken by the death of her own mother when she was a child. In “Nerve,” Holland also writes intimately about her fears of falling, of heights and, after she was involved in traumatic accidents, of driving. And she writes about the science behind those fears and the methods she and others have used to try to overcome them, including a therapy called E.M.D.R., or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Below, Holland talks about the scary day when she decided to write the book, the progress she made on her fears and how action movies have taught her some things about writing."

An orange, for example, contains nine grams of sugar but is good for you in terms of fiber and vitamin C. A chocolate chip cookie, on the other hand, contains approximately the same amount of sugar as the orange according to this app, but has few nutritional redeeming qualities other than being insanely delicious."

"5130","THE LAST DANCE 9 p.m. on ESPN. This has been a stressful year, so why not revisit happier times, such as, say, when Michael Jordan was playing with the Chicago Bulls? This 10-part documentary series was shot during the 1997-1998 season, when Jordan won his sixth and final title with the team. The show traces his career, before and after he became a force to be reckoned with on the court, and examines the triumphs and behind-the-scenes flare-ups during the heyday of the Bulls. It also gives considerable screen time to Jordan’s teammates Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, and head coach, Phil Jackson. A number of big names weigh in, including Bill Clinton, Justin Timberlake and Barack Obama. The series debuts on April 19 with two episodes."

"5216","I was about nine years old, curiously but quietly poking about my grandmother Madeleine L’Engle’s manuscripts so as not to disturb her writing and risk losing the privilege of keeping her company in her “Ivory Tower” while she worked. The Tower was just a room over the garage in the eighteenth-century New England farmhouse where she and my grandfather had lived and raised three children during the 1950s and where they still spent weekends, holidays, and long stretches of summer. I’m not sure who christened it “the Tower,” but the name was used ironically by both her and the rest of the family, an acknowledgment of the privilege of solitude and time. The manuscripts I was poking about in were housed in repurposed ream boxes with words like “Eaton” and “Corrasable Bond” on the sides, and in black three-ring binders whose leather casings were beginning to crack. There were dozens of boxes and binders, including ones with A Wrinkle in Time, The Arm of the Starfish, and A Wind in the Door written on them, but I wasn’t interested in the manuscripts of stories that could be read as real books: I was more curious about the scraps and stories and studies in the other boxes. I came across “Gilberte Must Play Bach” in one of those. I’m not sure why I stopped to read this particular one, but I liked the French name in the title, and the imperative. The story was strange to me, and sad, and although the girl in the story was named Claudine, I understood it to be autobiographical. The sadness of the story—and its unresolvedness—shook me and gave me a glimpse at the depth of things we might discover about the people we love."

She was sitting on the white sheets of an unmade hotel bed and looking straight at the camera, her knees tucked underneath her. The school bus driver thought his wife looked odd in these vacation pictures. She’d never posed this way before, for him. Her black hair was set in big soft curls and she looked like a child’s doll: blue eyelids, long artificial eyelashes, round rosy cheeks, red lips. She would never, on her own, make herself up like this. This bikini would never be something she’d choose for herself. “Hee keyow,” she would say, shaking her head in disapproval if he ever suggested she wear anything even slightly revealing. This bikini must have been Frank’s idea."

"5549","When the federal aid package for small businesses known as the Paycheck Protection Program was announced last month, it seemed to offer a lifeline for modest enterprises in dire need of help because of the coronavirus crisis. Passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress, the program offered $349 billion in forgivable loans — essentially bridge loans — to provide the liquidity needed until the economy recovers. Unlike big-industry bailouts, which generate both moral hazard and public anger, the plan held out the attractive promise of providing relief for the smallest shops on Main Street."

"5578","My wife and I, both restaurant chefs who have abruptly lost our jobs, have been living for more than a month soberly and devoutly conserving our resources. You could mistake us for back-to-the-land homesteaders. I gave her a haircut, and she sprouted the scallions on the windowsill. I’ve learned to make the cottony Kaiser rolls my kids love that we usually buy from the deli.

When I got there, my co-workers were screaming with laughter, and I heard my boss say: “The other weird thing Lauren does is….” But then he realized I was there and stopped. My co-workers looked uncomfortable, and my boss pivoted quickly by asking about my first meeting. I was mortified! It was all I could do not to cry. How can I find out what weird things I do, so I can stop? I don’t want to be the office weirdo."

Adapted from a satirical children’s book by Lois Lowry, “The Willoughbys” concerns neglected siblings (voiced by Will Forte, Alessia Cara and Seán Cullen) who hatch a plan to get rid of their comically inattentive parents (Jane Krakowski and Martin Short). The ensuing story involves chases, betrayals and many nods to famous children’s books — including the presence of a friendly nanny (Maya Rudolph) and a candy man (Terry Crews). “Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review of the movie for The New York Times, “‘The Willoughbys’ thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign.”"

Adapted from a satirical children’s book by Lois Lowry, “The Willoughbys” concerns neglected siblings (voiced by Will Forte, Alessia Cara and Seán Cullen) who hatch a plan to get rid of their comically inattentive parents (Jane Krakowski and Martin Short). The ensuing story involves chases, betrayals and many nods to famous children’s books — including the presence of a friendly nanny (Maya Rudolph) and a candy man (Terry Crews). “Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review of the movie for The New York Times, “‘The Willoughbys’ thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign.”"

It’s estimated that 20 million victory gardens flourished in the United States that year, and New York City alone produced 200 million pounds of tomatoes, beans, beets, carrots and lettuce. Seventy-seven years later, as millions of Americans are self-quarantined, and many worry about trips to the grocery store and the strength of the food-supply chain, the coronavirus pandemic has revived the victory-garden movement. “There is a simple, beautiful logic to having food security within your own home,” says David Godshall, the principal of the Los Angeles- and San Francisco-based landscape architecture studio Terremoto. “In my lifetime, I don’t think there’s ever been a more pertinent moment to start gardening.” For those wondering what will thrive in a limited outdoor space, the short answer is lots. A small garden on a rooftop or balcony can produce abundant harvests. Even inside, a sunny windowsill can yield fragrant clouds of herbs such as mint, lemon verbena, thyme, rosemary and Thai basil. Below, a handful of urban-garden experts explain how to grow your own food in a space of any size."

The message was disorienting — a dispatch from a dystopian future, delivered in the present. The evidence in Italy was undeniable and yet in an America before lockdowns, their crisis was, for many, an abstraction. Even medical professionals preparing for the worst in America seemed to struggle to hold the coming devastation in their minds. “We are starting to see some cases in our hospitals, but it’s nothing like what doctors in Italy are describing,” New York City E.R. doctor Helen Ouyang wrote in a diary during the second week of March. “They warn me that we are about two weeks behind them.

"6003","It was Day 8 of quarantine for me and my family. My son had returned from his semester abroad in Europe, and so we were all hunkered down in our Brooklyn house, cooking, eating, working together and listening to music. Dean, 20, was mostly in charge of the soundtrack and had just put on Bob Dylan’s “Tonight I’ll Be Staying Here With You” on Spotify."
"6004","I call my mother every afternoon to check in on her. She lives in a three-story Section 8 building in East New York, Brooklyn, in the apartment my siblings and I grew up in. Three of her neighbors died from Covid-19 in the last two weeks, and more than half of the families in her 12-unit building are sick. Through the walls she could hear the wails of the family who lost a loved one to the virus next door: “Don’t go! Please don’t leave us!” Another neighbor on the second floor, a middle-aged Ecuadorean man who lived with his elderly mother, died the day before Easter. The worst part, she said, is not being able to pay her respects in person, to say goodbye to the neighbors that over the years have become her family. I feel my stomach turn with guilt."

I’d just turned 30 and had recently moved from Brighton to Oxford, having taken a job on a whim, again, moving out of one rented house in one city and into another as I had done throughout my 20s. But the new job was stressful. I spent long hours at the office in front of a screen.

"6228","BAD EDUCATION (2020) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney star in this dark comedy-drama, a cross between “Election” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.” The movie, directed by Cory Finley (“Thoroughbreds”), reimagines a multi-million-dollar embezzlement scandal that rocked a high school on Long Island in 2004. The mastermind behind the scheme is Frank Tassone (Jackman), the superintendent of the school district, who wins over parents and students alike with his good-natured charm. His machination lasts years, and it slowly starts to crumble only after he encourages a student journalist (Geraldine Viswanathan) to dig deeper into a puff piece she’s working on. (Big mistake.) In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that Jackman steals the show. His role is “a plum part” and “a chance for the actor to channel his charisma toward dark, mischievous ends.”"

Adapted from a satirical children’s book by Lois Lowry, “The Willoughbys” concerns neglected siblings (voiced by Will Forte, Alessia Cara and Seán Cullen) who hatch a plan to get rid of their comically inattentive parents (Jane Krakowski and Martin Short). The ensuing story involves chases, betrayals and many nods to famous children’s books — including the presence of a friendly nanny (Maya Rudolph) and a candy man (Terry Crews). “Though it tends to feel disjointed as a whole,” Natalia Winkelman wrote in her review of the movie for The New York Times, “‘The Willoughbys’ thrives when it embraces its grim plot and lets mischief reign.”"

"6266","A little more than a month ago, as the pandemic was taking flight here in America, I found myself, like so many other nouveau preppers, cruising around my local grocery store in search of provisions. On my way to the checkout, I passed a tiered display of flowers and plants — funnel-shaped bouquets of carnations; potted pastel tulips; lone orchids, their delicate flamingo-neck stems held gracefully aloft — and was snagged by a flash of waxy green leaves and umbels of tiny magenta flowers. The plant was a Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, a blooming succulent that flowers in the winter months. “But I am here to buy coffee and Clorox wipes,” I told myself, as “My Misspent Youth” (1999), that Meghan Daum essay about going broke while buying fresh-cut flowers every week, flashed in my mind. And yet, at this sad moment, these bright cheerful blossoms hit me in the gut, stirring up a tangle of emotions: joy, hope, yearning for a time when I would have bought them without worrying they were frivolous, sadness for all the florists and vendors whose businesses are now shuttered. Suddenly I had to have them. The plant felt like a signifier of my past self, and a talisman against palpable, creeping despair. The purchase seemed almost utilitarian."

A shape-shifting demon inspired by Mexican folklore (played by Natalie Dormer of “Game of Thrones”) somehow ties into all of this, while subplots involving Nazi insurgents and police brutality bring the series, or at least its themes, to the present. “Even though our show is set in 1938, it has to be about 2020 or it has no reason to exist,” Logan said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “Race relations, social engineering, politics, espionage — all of that was bubbling away exactly the way it’s bubbling away now.” The series finale of HOMELAND leads in at 9 p.m."

Their children, often the most mature people in the room, look on, mortified. One morning after the worst of the infighting has ended, everybody heads outside for a sloppy, impromptu soccer match under a light snowfall — adults and kids, women and men, socialists and materialists. In the chaos of the game, all is forgiven."

"7075","In 1916, Albert Einstein made a prediction he thought could never be proved. He proposed that the acceleration or collision of stellar masses, such as black holes, would cause ripples that warp space and time. He called them gravitational waves.

I had peppermint oil and blood on my hands when we first heard him cry. Outside, the storm stripped ginkgos bare, burying the sidewalks under damp gold leaves. — Joshua Cornwell"

The drill, it seems, is intended to simulate defensive pressure, and Winston, looking trim and coiled, evades the bag each time."

The days oozing on by, unfurling on top of one another, without the clear distinctions of commutes, errands, routines and workplaces to orient us.

To get your balance, stretch out your arms loosely to either side like wings, elbows bent, palms forward.

Beans, I thought. Definitely beans. Specifically, rajma chawal, the Punjabi-style red beans and rice that I grew up with, bobbing in a garlicky, gingery tomato sauce, finished with a generous glug of heavy cream and some quick-pickled onion. This was my family’s store-cupboard comfort food — the dish my mother made on our first night home after being away, because a version of it could be assembled from whatever was already in the pantry and fridge."

Their children play on the island and the street in front of my house, while the parents crowd around. No one wears masks. The space gets so crowded that my children cannot safely play on our lawn. Today, I came home to find the neighbors’ children playing on my front lawn. How do I ask them to respect social distancing rules?"

"7350","Audience participation may be one of the less lamented live experiences we’re missing out on now. No matter how brilliant a play is, interaction is a deal breaker for a good number of the theater faithful."
"7351","At the Golden Tip service station, somewhere in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, they pump more than gas. Drive up, tell the handsome attendant “I want to go to Dreamland,” and he’s yours, for a fee."
"7352","When a relative of mine recently became seriously ill with what seemed to be a coronavirus infection, my first question was about timing. How many days ago did your symptoms start?"
"7353","You need read only a small portion of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” Thomas Piketty’s towering 2013 economic and historical survey of the dynamics of inequality, to know that Piketty, a French academic, is not only a brilliant economist but also one with a gift for making complicated ideas accessible. But the text runs around 750 pages, and not everyone is prepared to plow through Piketty’s methodical analysis of capital-income ratios from 1700 to the near-present."
"7354","The early scenes of “Tesnota (Closeness)” — the first feature directed by Kantemir Balagov, whose subsequent “Beanpole” was Russia’s 2019 entry for the international feature Academy Award — convey unsettling sexual intrigue and old-fashioned exuberance. The tomboyish Ilana (Darya Zhovner) and her brother David (Veniamin Katz), part of a working-class Jewish family living in the Russian town of Nalchik in 1998, have an unusually close relationship. A little before David’s engagement party, the siblings have a cheeky discussion on how “lucky” David’s betrothed is, given his sexual equipment. Whoa."

"7356","One Friday last month, Mike Hadreas fell asleep in a “Cruel Intentions” T-shirt and got up later that morning for a Zoom interview. He’d been up late, in his Los Angeles home, so he took the call in bed. Not something he’d normally do. The Zoom, the wee hours."
"7357","The sun, like all stars, is a blazing ball of fusion-powered plasma. From its surface emerge magnetic field lines that can cause dark patches known as sunspots. Turn up the activity of these magnetic whorls, and you get more solar storms flinging deadly charged particles and radiation throughout our solar system. If enough of these punishing waves hit a rocky planet, that planet might end up microwaved into a dreary condition where nothing could live."
"7358","With college campuses closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, free virtual tours have grown in popularity. High school juniors hoping to begin college in the fall of 2021 are not able to visit campuses in person, but they and their families have many ways to explore their options while staying safe at home."
"7359","Got a tale to tell but don’t want to bang it out as a traditional book? Try doing it as a digital comic — and ignore anyone who thinks visual narratives are a lesser art form or basic fodder for Hollywood action movies.

"7366","WASHINGTON — One morning this week, President Trump called food sector executives. That afternoon, he met with corporate leaders at the White House. The day before, he paraded small-business owners in the East Room, and the day before that, he showcased executives from retail giants like Walgreens and Walmart in the Rose Garden."

It is about two and a half miles northeast of the Pearl district, across the Willamette River, and one-half mile west of Grant Park, a green space with recreational facilities that is the setting for a number of scenes in Beverly Cleary’s children’s books. The Irvington Tennis Club is four blocks west."

"7372","NORMAL PEOPLE Stream on Hulu. In one of their first scenes together, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), the Irish teenagers at the center of this series, have a conversation about that most weighty of adolescent subjects: their school grades. “You’re smarter than me,” Connell says. Marianne’s reply comes quickly, in a matter-of-fact tone: “Smarter than everyone,” she says. Based on the best-selling novel by Sally Rooney, “Normal People” follows the pair as they ricochet through an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. Their bond highlights issues of social class, as the pair — one wealthy, one poor — move from secondary school to university. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik called the series “a complex study of power wrapped up in a heartfelt teen soap.”"

She’s just struggling.” Batista doesn’t yet have an official diagnosis for her daughter, but, suspecting an attention deficit disorder, she has turned to CBD (cannabidiol) for help."
"7378","This month Fiona Apple released her fifth album, “Fetch the Bolt Cutters,” an event that was received with significant awe and rapturous praise. Apple often takes her time between records — her previous one, “The Idler Wheel …,” was released in 2012 — but the greeting she received was about much more than a long absence."

"7393","The filmmaker Mira Nair first tried to get Irrfan Khan to appear in one of her movies when he was a drama student in Delhi. And while the substantial part she offered him in “Salaam Bombay!” (1988) ended up being downsized, she promised him the lead in a feature film — one day. Nearly 20 years later, she kept her word, casting him as Ashoke Ganguli, the patriarch of an immigrant Bengali family in “The Namesake,” based on Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel. She gave him, she said, his “first gateway to the world.”"
"7394","They will not get to share in the memories synonymous with college graduation — the collective tossing of caps, the hugs from friends and the walk across the stage to get their diplomas."
"7395","The economic news has been terrible. Never mind Wednesday’s G.D.P. report for the first quarter. An economy contracting at an annual rate of almost 5 percent would have been considered very bad in normal times, but this report only captured the first few drops of a torrential downpour. More timely data show an economy falling off a cliff. The Congressional Budget Office is projecting an unemployment rate of 16 percent later this year, and that may well be an underestimate."
"7396","Even in a pandemic there are weavers and rippers. The weavers try to spiritually hold each other so we can get through this together. The rippers, from Donald Trump on down, see everything through the prism of politics and still emphasize division. For the rippers on left and right, politics is a war that gives life meaning."
"7397","“Until the Birds Return” opens with a car cruising down a winding, sun-dappled city street. This image becomes the connective tissue between three otherwise divergent stories in Karim Moussaoui’s tender, ruminative drama about life in contemporary Algeria."
"7398","The fiction feature directorial debut of the Guatemalan filmmaker César Díaz is a modestly scaled picture with massive implications. Díaz’s background is in editing, and there’s a strong documentary component in his filmography. So it’s fitting that in this picture the protagonist is a forensic anthropologist — one who is working on a project that goes back decades rather than centuries, which is usually what we see in movies featuring anthropologists."
"7399","SEOUL, South Korea — Seventy-eight workers, from nine different subcontractors, were busy Wednesday laying tiles and installing cargo elevators to meet a June deadline for completing a four-story cold-storage warehouse. Another crew was coating underground walls with polyurethane foam — a cheap but efficient insulator that can easily catch fire and then emit extremely toxic fumes."
"7400","Well, this is awkward."
"7401","WASHINGTON — The number of people targeted for court-approved surveillance by counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigators in 2019 plunged to its lowest level in at least seven years, a drop that coincided with intense scrutiny on the F.B.I.’s use of its national-security wiretapping power in the Trump-Russia investigation."

"7409","The coronavirus lockdown has separated many of us from our loved ones — in some instances, even our partners and spouses. As a relationship and sex therapist, I’ve been working with a number of clients who are living separately from their partners. One patient is a medical worker who treats coronavirus patients every day and has chosen to live separately from his spouse so as not to not to expose his family to the disease. In another relationship, the couple were traveling separately when the crisis struck, and they did not have the ability to get back to the same location, so they now reside 50 miles apart, with one partner living with her elderly parents."

My book is the story of a tenacious young woman and the constellation of factors that led to her homelessness. Little did I know how widespread those factors would become, how many more Americans would find themselves facing their own versions of what I witnessed."
"7417","Decades ago, self-isolating helped save my life. For one week each month, my husband cared for our children, who were 1, 3, and 5 at the time, while I navigated bottomed-out blood counts alone in my bedroom. Hairless and hungry for my children’s hugs, I threw them kisses from afar and watched their little fingers snatch the air to bring my love to their lips."

Covid-19 was still mainly confined to China. Italy was not yet in crisis and New York wasn’t even on our radar. But in hindsight, his return was prudent."

Cloaked in dim, ambient lighting, this chain of events recurs throughout the film, though some of his late-night forays, on foot or by bicycle, are actually dreams while others are revealed as cruising.

Beans, I thought. Definitely beans. Specifically, rajma chawal, the Punjabi-style red beans and rice that I grew up with, bobbing in a garlicky, gingery tomato sauce, finished with a generous glug of heavy cream and some quick-pickled onion. This was my family’s store-cupboard comfort food — the dish my mother made on our first night home after being away, because a version of it could be assembled from whatever was already in the pantry and fridge."
